Aston Martin,Aston Martin posts $41.5m loss amid falling demand,post-663668,"Oct 10, 2013",Sovereign,"Correct analysis. The only difference of opinion I have is about the looks. I have seen several recent Aston Martin cars and I don't find them as attractive as many people and especially the British press make them out to be imo. These cars are good looking but not to the extent the press is touting about. My favorite 2 door Aston is the Volante, Vantage from the 1980s. It had brutal looks.,Besides my subjective analysis of its design, I feel another reason could be that all Aston Martin current models are copy of each other and are based on the original DB7 that came out in 1994 I guess. It is essentially a one model company for the past two decades with some variations in light clusters and engine output.,Even Porsche with the legendary 911 cannot rely on one model. the 911 is unique not only in appearance but because of the drivetrain and hence the driving experience. If Porsche with its much loved 911 need other models to be profitable then how would Aston survive with only DB7 based models which do not offer the unique experience of 911.",#4,post: 663662,NA,Male,Academics,721,753,"VW Beetle,Toyota"

Bentley,Bentley announces record profits.,post-285310,"Mar 13, 2008",rev,"Mainstream carmakers may be worried about a downturn in the market but the ultra-luxury marques have nothing to fear if current sales levels are anything to go by. Bentley, for example, has posted record sales of 10,014 vehicles for 2007 and this in turn has led to new operating profit record of €155m based on sales of €1.37 billion.,Strong growth in most of Bentley’s major markets as well as a staggering 93% increase in sales in China were the key reasons for the positive results. Even in North America, where the auto industry has slowed, Bentley’s sales were up 4%. Though the bulk of sales were for the entry-level Continental GT, the results were also driven by growth across both the Arnage and new Azure convertible models.,When you consider that just five years ago Bentley was only selling 1,000 vehicles per year, the luxury marque is now on the verge of losing significant brand-cachet.

The two main problems I have had are (1) squealing brakes... and when a say ""squealing"" I mean SERIOUSLY SCREAMING !  The dealer told me it was a common problem with the Vantage and I should drive the car really fast on the motorway and brake really hard to deglaze the pads ! Thats basically their way of not fixing the problem or trying to kill me so they dont have to!  Anyway, I tried it, but it didnt work.  Eventually, I couldnt drive the car without wearing ear defenders and dark glasses, it was so embarrassing pulling up in a 90k car that sounds like a braking roller coaster! Eventually they took the car in to fix it.  I was left without a car for 3 weeks, they finally returned it and it was as if they had not even done anything.  The same problem was there.  Even If they did actually do something, they clearly didnt test their work but my guess is they did nothing, they have been useless (2) the clutch burnt out within 3000 miles.

The number plate has also been repositioned, now inset in the bumper and lending the tailgate a more streamlined look.,Inside, the beautifully ornate interior should benefit from even higher quality materials and more standard equipment.,The engine line-up is expected to be overhauled, with Aston Martin looking to slash emissions and boost economy, while retaining the performance that’s at the brand’s heart. This means it’s likely to retain its lustrous V12 engine, but tweaks will ensure lower fuel bills.,While the model is being touted as an all-new car, it will sit on the existing ‘VH’ platform developed for the original DB9 in 2004, representing more of a re-skin in the same vein as the Porsche 996/997 evolution of 2005.,Details of a revamped DB9 were revealed at the same time as it was announced that Aston has extended its engine-supply tie-up with Ford until 2016 – at which point an all-new DB model will go on sale, built on an all-new platform.,For now though Aston is riding high on its recent financial successes; the One-77 hyper car and the entry-level Cygnet, which it’s hoped, this new model will build upon."",Read more:",#1,,Earth,Male,NA,327,521,

According to this report,  it appears to indicate that the partnership is firmed up as of late  2010. It also indicates that the upcoming next-generation S-Class/W222  chassis will underpin the next-generation Maybach range, as well as a  large Lagonda luxury sedan/saloon,  and I could believe this more so, for the VH chassis, which much of the  Aston-Martin range is based upon, up to the Rapide, is stretched as far  as it could go for the new 4-door coupe. The VH essentially couldn't  get any larger, justifying the upcoming W222 chassis to be used, which  makes much sense.,The report also goes on to mention a crossover/SUV for Lagonda, which  would be based upon the new-generation M/GL chassis, but be styled  differently than the odd concept from Geneva from 2009 or so. If this is  the case, it would mean the the new-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee,  Dodge Durango, upcoming new-generation Mercedes-Benz ML and GL, the  reported Maserati SUV, and this Lagonda crossover/SUV will all share the  same basic DNA! That SUV chassis was in development when Chrysler was  under the Daimler umbrella, and regarded as very solid and capable.",#64,,"Northvale, NJ",NA,NA,39,10,"2006 Nissan Murano,1996 Nissan Maxima,1963 Pontiac Bonneville convertible"

Renault,New Renault Twingo,post-160445,"Mar 6, 2007",siko,"A longstanding player in the small car segment, Renault has sold more than 2.4 million Twingos since the model's launch in April 1993. The release of New Twingo, which will go on sale in June 2007, forms part of Renault Commitment 2009 and the introduction of 26 new cars, including 13 aimed at conquering new markets. New Twingo boosts Renault's presence in the small car segment alongside Clio Campus, Modus and Clio III.,Thanks to its chassis derived from the B-segment and a powertrain range featuring the new TCE (Turbo Control Efficiency) 100hp petrol engine, which offers class-leading performance and fuel consumption, New Twingo's superior dynamics set it apart from its predecessor. New Twingo also targets a broader, more international clientele thanks to the distinctly dynamic styling of the GT version and the robust lines of the other versions, plus the availability for the first time of right-hand drive models for the British market and the introduction of a benchmark 1.5 dCi diesel engine.,New Twingo stands out as a further illustration of Renault's know-how in the domain of optimizing cabin space and interior versatility, by making full use of the car’s compact dimensions (length: 3.60m). The interior is extremely modular thanks to its four independent sliding seats. Meanwhile, New Twingo's boot volume is the biggest in its segment, ranging from 165 to 285 litres (VDA) with all four seats in place and extendable to a full 959 litres with a two-seater layout. With the front passenger seatback tipped forward, New Twingo can even carry loads of up to 2.15m in length.,Communicative and occupant-friendly, New Twingo features an Audio Connection Box (in UK we will be calling this system ‘multi-functional TunePoint’) which enables personal music collections stored on USB keys, portable MP3 players or iPods® to be played through the car's audio system and operated via the steering wheel-mounted controls. Twingo is also available with hands-free Bluetooth telephone controls complete with 'hold' function for safer motoring.,In keeping with the ""my Twingo"" philosophy, buyers can customize their new car – inside and out – thanks to a range of decorative decals for the exterior and a selection of innovative accessories such as the Organizer Box and Makeup Box for the interior.,Safety was at the forefront of the New Twingo design team's priorities. Their work covers all aspects of this key area, from positive, predictable roadholding and accident prevention systems to occupant protection in case of impact. New Twingo's robust construction, braking and suspension performance, ergonomics and equipment from the next segment up put the car at the top end of the small city car segment in terms of safety and ensure its ability to pass even the most stringent crash tests. Numerous comfort and safety features not previously available for Twingo have also been introduced, including lateral airbags, automatic climate control, cruise control/speed limiter, height-adjustable steering wheel and automatic headlamp activation, etc.,New Twingo is nonetheless very affordable, both to buy and to run. Powered by the 1.5 dCi engine, it combines miserly fuel consumption and equally low CO2 emissions of 113g/km. Indeed, CO2 emissions do not exceed 140g/km even with the most powerful engine and New Twingo makes a valuable contribution to the '120-140g/km of CO2' pledge of Renault Commitment 2009.,New Twingo is the first model to be renewed within the framework of Renault Commitment 2009 and had to meet an extremely exacting brief in terms of quality and profitability.

Internal Combustion,"BMW M5 vs. Cadillac CTS-V, Mercedes-AMG E63 S, Porsche Panamera Turbo",post-879483,"Mar 22, 2018",asrapid1,"Our test of 600-hp cars nine years ago looked very different from this one. Fenders bulged. Eight-, 10-, and 12-cylinder engines boomed. Hoods stretched to the horizon—except for that of the Italian, which carried its engine behind the cockpit. Because nine years ago, rounding up four cars with 600 horsepower meant coming face to face with rare and exotic sporting machines. We called them “the pinnacle of the automotive food chain.” They were a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, a Dodge Viper SRT10, a Lamborghini Murciélago LP640, and a Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series. It was 2009, and as the economy cratered and stiff fuel-economy mandates brewed, it was tempting to assume that the halcyon days of horsepower would soon be behind us.,It doesn’t appear as if automakers plan to cut us off anytime soon, though. When 600 horsepower seems unexceptional, you know you’re living in exceptional times. Packaged as it is for this comparison test—in four-door bodies, produced exclusively by blown V-8s, and paired with automatic transmissions—600 horsepower today looks markedly less exotic than it did back in 2009. But don’t be fooled—this much power will always blow your mind.,The BMW M5 is the newest in the set, and while it looks familiar, inside and out, it features two notable format changes: An eight-speed automatic transmission has taken over for the six-speed manual and seven-speed dual-clutch offered in the prior model, and standard all-wheel drive promises to shrink acceleration times. A rear-wheel-drive mode allows drivers to appreciate how masterfully all-wheel drive wrangles the full might of the 600-hp 4.4-liter V-8, particularly since it’s only available once stability control has been fully defeated. M5 pricing starts at $104,595 and runs $127,295 as equipped for our test, with the $4000 Executive package (soft-close doors, four-zone climate control, massaging and heated front seats, plus heated rears, among other equipment) making the M5 as lavish as it is sporting.,Cadillac’s 640-hp CTS-V is the outlier, nestling a supercharger in the valley of its V-8, where everyone else stuffs two turbochargers, and delivering torque to only the rear wheels. It’s also the value play, as it’s the sole car here that can be bought for five figures. The Caddy’s price, however, pushes to $102,935 with big-ticket options such as Recaro performance seats ($2300), the performance data and video recorder ($1600), the Luxury package ($2500), and an exterior carbon-fiber package ($6250). The price is kept in check, at least in part, because Cadillac doesn’t offer carbon-ceramic brakes, an option that costs between $8500 and $8960 on the three other cars assembled.,The body control of the BMW isn’t cinched as tightly as it is on the Cadillac or the Porsche, and that isn’t a bad thing. There’s information to be gleaned from the way the body bounds and leans: how much load individual tires are carrying and how the road camber is changing. This is the analog feedback loop that was notably absent in the sober previous M5. That car at times felt as large and aloof as a 7-series. The new one drives more like a grown-up M3.,The front buckets are seemingly infinitely adjustable and cross-country comfortable, although they sit quite high and all those motors and bladders make the seatback extra thick, which eats into the rear-seat legroom. Rich materials and impeccable build quality abound inside, although it appears that even BMW’s own designers are bored with the current long-in-the-tooth design motif. How else do you explain an infotainment system that can be controlled by waving a hand in the air? The luxury never left BMW’s M5, though. Now that the playful chassis is back in balance with a more potent engine, the M5 is again the king of the hill.,car and driver",#1,,Croatia,Male,Mechanical engineer,128,237,

I was thinking about which car be a benchmark and decided to stop on Porsche 911 Turbo S. It’s a bechmark for a sportscar since it came out in 1975, it’s not just track-focused hardcore stuff, but all-arounder ,plus it has many results.,The main problem is the lap time of single track doesn’t show real abilities of the car. What if I want to make a world trip, which one should I choose?,I’ve taken some results from well-known magazines (all took from fasteslaps). I looked on the tracks which could give me lots of material for work:,Laguna Seca (Motor Trend, USA),Autocar Dry Handling Test (Autocar, GB),Sachsenring (AutoBild, Germany),Hockhenheim Short (AMS, Germany),Le Mans Bugatti (France),Magny-Cours Club (Motor Sport, France),To fill the gaps, I added some else:,Anglesey Coastal (EVO, GB),Moscow Raceway GP (Autoreview, Russia),Fuji (Best Motoring, Japan),Ring Knutstrop (Sweden),Oschersleben (Germany),Nordschliefe isn’t included because due to it’s length it would mess up all the results. These are regular tracks with lap time from 1 to 2 minutes.,The idea is simple as orange. I made calculations of average speed gap on every track. Average is 5 track results. Somewhere is just one, it’s noted. The ones that get average lap time slower than 911 Turbo S is in left column. The ones that are faster is in right one. Once again, I chose choosen between “normal” civil cars, so no Radicals, Zonda Rs etc here.,The result is next:,Porsche 911 Turbo S (560 PS) has better average lap time, than (seconds),+0,1 Lambo Huracan (610 ps),+0,1 Lambo Aventador (700 ps),+0,3 Ferrari 458 Italia (570 ps),+0,4 Lambo Gallardo 570 Superleggera (570 ps),+0,8 Audi R8 Plus ’16 (610 ps),+0,8 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta (740 ps),+1,1 Koenigsegg CCR (806 ps) (1 result),+1,3 Lexus LFA/Nurburgring (560-570 ps),+1,4 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 C6 (649 ps),+2,0 Mercedes AMG GT S (510 ps),+2,0 Lambo Gallardo LP560 (560 ps),+2,0 Nissan GT-R mkII-III (530-550 ps),+2,5 Nissan GT-R mkI (485 ps),+2,9 Audi R8 Plus quattro (550 ps),+3,3 Dodge Viper SRT (649 ps),+3,8 Audi R8 V10 (525 ps),+4,0 Chevrolet Corvette C7 (466 ps),+4,4 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 '13 (659 ps),+4,7 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 '12 (588 ps),+5,9 Jaguar F-Type R Coupe (550 ps),+7,8 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX (280 ps, for fun),+14,6 Tesla Model S P85D (700 ps) (1 result, for fun),Porsche 911 Turbo S is slower, than,-0,1 Ferrari 458 Speciale (605 ps),-0,3 Nissan GT-R Nismo (600+ ps),-0,3 McLaren MP4-12C (600-625 ps),-0,3 Porsche 997 GT2 RS (620 ps),-0,4 Ferrari 488 GTB (670 ps) (1 result),-0,5 McLaren 650S (650 ps),-0,8 Porsche 991 GT3 RS (500 ps),-0,9 Lambo Aventador 750SV (750 ps) (1 result),-2,9 McLaren P1 (916 ps),-3,5 Porsche 918 Spyder (887 ps),Maybe all this looks useless, but I made such experiment.

Internal Combustion,Mercedes-Benz CLS - Old vs. New (Styling),post-485950,"Oct 20, 2010",johnzzx,"Exterior wise I like both equally, with the slight favor towards the original design. The contour lines of the original CLS are soft and calm while on the new one they are edger and bolder. The lines of the original CLS reminds me of a female's body. The new CLS is more masculine with its lines and straight grill. Moreover, the new tail lights really remind me of a Solara or a Hyundai. Anyone noticed that Mercedes have been hiring quite a few Korean designers? Remember the F800? No offense to Korean designers, but maybe this explains the resemblance to Hyundai.,Can anyone explain why they like the new interior much more? It looks different but not decisively better to me. Although I don't like how the NAV is moved up like BMWs do, I can understand it's for safety. But the square buttons on the steering wheel and the square clock in the middle of the center console is the deal breaker for me. Yeah the square design is consistent with its exterior but I still hate them, almost as much as I hate Audi's turning wheels (instead of buttons) on their steering wheel.,To me the original CLS is sexy and unique, and although the new CLS is still a stunning car, the new design has lost its originality and its edge over other manufactures.,To Karabiner98k, I think the new CLS class has more resemblance to the CL class rather than to the S class, especially the front.

Brakes, acceleration, how it is standing the car on the road in difficult conditions (braking in corners, taking curves at high speed, accelerating in curves, changing direction at high speed) and I concluded that the new model is not better then the old one (except for the gear that is smoother and a little bit faster at the new model; but the old one is more brutal). If you are inside it is obvious that the new one has less space for the front seats but more space for the back seats; for the trunk, you simply can't compare: the old one has a much bigger and geometricaly regular trunk. As for the style, I like more the old dashboard (wich is more special), the front lights are better for the new one but the the backlights are better for the old one. The exterior shape of the old one is a true lesson of design, but at the new one you have an example of how you can work a lot to find new lines and, at the end, you discover that you lose the spirit of the concept.

The interior was beautiful...Piano black trim and white premium leather contrasted in tasteful black stitching - while the dash was wrapped in a subtle and artistically contoured black leather, seamlessly flowing into the side door panels. It felt luxurious. I've never been impressed by BMW interiors before. I stand corrected now. To those whom the M6 seems a bit pedestrian, you can opt to get individual trims on the M6 as well, to suit your taste, ranging from reds and rich browns, metals, woods, etc.,The Bentley won't handle like the M6. Yes, the Bentley exudes class and the interior is beautiful, the attention to detail is staggering. 36 hours are spent on the construction and placement of the steering wheel alone...but the exterior is clunky. Whereas the M6 is aesthetically pleasing but masculine, and it posses a ferocious character underneath. For my money, M6 all the way!!!,1) purchase a 2013 BMW M6 loaded to the max @ approx $130k. 2) Lease a 2013 Range Rover Supercharged. Both vehicles are stunning, more practical and together, cost as much as that fatty Bentley.",#105,,NA,Male,NA,1,5,

At first, I was like everyone else- I thought the rear was hideous and too Korean. I literally hated this rear for months, wondering what the M-B designers were thinking when they conceived this thing. But as cliche as this sounds, it grew on me, and when it did, it grew fast. Every time I looked at the rear, it gave me something different. I distinctly remember seeing the E-Class for the first time at night, and my opinions began to change.,Then I saw it again, and then again. It took a few more appearances until I saw something ground-breaking enough about the rear that convinced me that it was distinctively Mercedes Benz. To me, the beauty of it is intangible. I have a hard time describing,it is so beautiful, but can only conclude that,Francis Bacon once said, ""There is no beauty that hath not some strangeness"", and I think it perfectly describes the W212. The rear is strange, and to many people, debatable. But as the W212 was given a few more months and the arrival of the CLS, it all began to make sense. M-B proved that they are able to produce (and I quote a previous poster), a stately, solid sedan, and juxtapose it with the CLS, a more radical 4-door coupe that has an appearance with a more immediate effect.,I must say that the 5 series is gorgeous. It's clean, simple, and like the CLS, easy to like immediately. However, it's no where as interesting as the W212. It's a very safe design that will appeal to the masses, but will not be anything that gives one an ""aha"" moment. It's questionable whether or not a car should make one think so much, but its just so much more attractive when it does.",#77,,NA,NA,NA,20,12,

It will not be an X5M, but that is not because I do not want one, it is just that at R 1,250,000, it is a little out of my price range.,I scuba dive at Sodwana / Mozambique once or twice a year, I venture out to the game parks 4 times a year and generally I live an average existence for a South African. I do not need a SUV with a low range transfer case that can climb 45 degrees and wade through a bog, I need an activity vehicle that offers ground clearance coupled with more ""activity"" than a normal estate. For me, the limited off-road ability of an X-Series BMW is all I will ever need - I can take it onto the beach at Sodwana, I can drive it to Mozambique, I can drive it to the 4x4 areas of Dullstroom, all whilst enjoying the fact that it still drives like a BMW and that is something that I can enjoy 99% of the time when I am cruising through the urban jungle.,As far as I am concerned, BMW have their target market spot on. For me, the X5M is a dream car (based on my needs and desires). I would die for one and would definitely use every part of its versatility without needing a full blown 4x4 that weighs almost 3 tonnes (ala Range Rover).,I am just giving a different slant on this argument. For me, the approach of BMW and Audi is actually all I will ever need (and dare I say that most people would fall into this category).

Cawimmer compared it to the CLS, but while it is the same marketing train of thinking that brought X6 to life, I feel BMW missed the boat with this one.,For one thing, the market is turning against SUV's and gus-guzzlers and the every car company is trying to promote its green credentials. It will be very hard for BMW to make the X6 fall in line with the current zeitgeist. On the other hand, the styling is too forced and I don't see very much imgaination in it. Taking an SUV and mating it with a coupe profile has not produced a succesful sgtyling result. The overall concept is very compromised. As has been emphasised, it manages to combine the worst of the SUV and coupe worlds. It is a brilliant technical excercise no doubt about it - the way X6 appears to handle pushes the SUV performance envelope - but the resources might have been put to a better use elsewhere, like a supercar or Nissan GT-R fighter. X6 might sell well, even fulfilling its expectations, but that says more about BMW's brand image than anything else. The problem is X6 does nothing to advance that brand image.,Overall, I agree with the Autozeitung result. Somehow, practicality or comfort are more important to this segment than outright speed.

It offers decent economy and emissions reductions over the 1.9 TDI, so will appeal to private and company buyers alike. As it sits in the lowest 13 per cent company car tax bracket, a higher-band business user would shave £298 a year off their bill, while your annual tax disc will be £85 cheaper.,As a result, the Bluemotion’s £520 price premium doesn’t seem unreasonable, especially as the driving experience is unaffected. However, with stop-start and brake regeneration, BMW’s Efficient Dynamics is more advanced, while adding it to the whole range without charging extra is a smart move.,The 118d is pricier than the Golf, but the 2.0-litre engine is more powerful, quieter and smoother than its rival. Linear power delivery, involving handling and sharp dynamics make it a great car to drive. The harsh ride and lack of practicality are familiar 1-Series shortcomings, but we feel it’s far more desirable than the Golf.,So the 118d wins, and based on this performance, Efficient Dynamics has the edge on Bluemotion in the eco battle.",#1,,NA,Male,NA,403,"1,102",

Internal Combustion,Toyota Prius proves a gas guzzler in a race with the BMW 520d,post-287190,"Mar 20, 2008",bensmatt,"1. S class is larger and heavier than LS460L.,2. S550 is disadvantaged in that it does not feature direct injection. Mind you that MB has gasoline  direct injection engine since 2002(W203 C200GCI). A plausible reason for that situation is the fact some important MB S class market(e.g. middle east & china ) lacks good availability of high quality gasoline needed for Direct injection to operate reliably. MB can not have two version of the same engine either. Potential customers in middle east and china certainly would not be happy that they are being offered a less advanced & less powerful version of the S-class, like being treated as second class citizens.,Also, I don't know where the S550 0-60 number comes from. MBUSA has it at 5.4 sec.,A lot of extra weight increase(vs. base LS460L) is from the hybrid system itself(battery pack, motors & power electronics module). As we all know, more weight equals poorer handling.,From the numbers posted, it seems LS600HL is a failure. It's got slightly slower 0 to 60 time than the base LS460L. It handles poorly due to 375kg of extra weight. It actually consumes more fuel than the base LS460L when driven on highway. True, it is more fuel efficient in city. But if you brake it harder, it returns to a normal car rather fast, because brake regeneration power is limited, larger proportion of energy would have to be dispersed through brake, like a normal car. In any case, the hybrid LS does not justify its significantly higher cost. Even in turns of environmental impact, production of hybrid components(Nickel metal hydride battery and motors with lots of copper winding) are extra to base LS460L. Normally, hybrid cars offset those extra environmental cost during production through less tailpipe CO2 emission, which correlated to less fuel consumption. But in case of LS600HL, its fuel economy gain is slight to none-existent. So, in the end, it is not green at all.,And all above is without even mentioning the standard toyota hybrid disadvantages: poor handling, less space, battery replacement after few years.,And no, the awd argument would not save LS600HL either. Take GS350rwd and GS350awd acceleration and fuel economy data and extrapolate the difference to a hypothetical rwd LS600HL, and the acceleration and fuel economy argument above is still valid. But the real issue is, with a heavy battery pack in the trunk and driven mostly in city, is awd really needed? And furthermore, why isn't a rwd model offered in addition to awd model?,I don't know what toyota is thinking, the car is just pointless.,In fact, I would argue that LS600HL gives hybrid technology a bad name by applying hybrid technology so poorly. Even a Hybrid Chevy Tahoe, a full size SUV, gets 20mpg city and 20mpg highway, though it is slower(8.2sec 0 – 60mph). But what is remarkable is the SUV has much higher wind resistance(cd 0.27 vs cd 0.34) and weighs almost 500lb more than the LS600HL. Plus GM's SUV uses a push rod engine while the lexus has a direct injection engine with all the gizmo.,Personally, I think diesel and HCCI Hybrid is the way to go for the future. But before that, better hybrid battery technology is required. More energy density for space and weight efficiency, more power density for better brake regeneration and acceleration performance.,oh, come on...

Internal Combustion,Swedish AMS: BMW 330i vs Mercedes C280,post-233582,"Sep 23, 2007",tmehanna,"280 is indeed the 330i's Stuttgart equivalent, comparison is perfectly fair from a displacement as well as a price point of view. If Mercedes cannot match BMW's power output from the same displacement, or decided not to - for the sake of reliability - that's their problem not anyone else's. As I don't usually do any road - or track - racing, and having driven both cars, I can vouch for the Benz's superiority as a means of transport whose primary purpose is to get me from point A to point B in maximum comfort. Whatever oomph the benz loses to the beamer, it more than makes up for it with its big car feel, tasteful interior and comfort. As a matter of fact I didn't like the beamer's overcommunicative steering at all, I'd rather not know of every single road irregularity, and driven in a straight line, the BMW didn't feel special, unlike the C which felt like a tank, in the good sense of the word. Although I didn't have the chance to drive the beamer through a slalom run, the benz's limits through the run where much further than my own and it did everything I wanted it to do, exactly how I wanted it to do it. If BMW can better that, good for them, but I don't need more. To be quite honest, I have always liked benzes over beamers, I even thought the W203 would have been a better car than E90 if it hadn't been for that TERRIBLE steering with that dead on-center feel, like 2 inches of freeplay, and too much self centering at speed that it felt I was fighting against the car in high speed sweepers. Now that the W204 has proper steering and better everything, I bought one",#129,,NA,NA,NA,11,3,

I have had two SAABs (9-5 Aero) that my wife uses as a daily driver.  Both were great cars.  The current one (2003 model year) is an excellent car.  We have had it since new, and have had only 1 (very) minor problem with the driver's visor.,It is an excellent freeway cruiser, comfortable and quiet with plenty of pep.  I have had it up to about 140MPH, and while it didn't feel quite as solid as my RS4, it was plenty stable.  In spirited driving in the twisties, it does get a little nose heavy because of the FWD, but it still handles well.  The 9-5 is also bigger/heavier than the 9-3, so I'm guessing that the 9-3 will handle better.  I have looked at the new 9-3, and I think that it is a stylish ride.  The interior is also well thought out and comfortable.,The lease on our 9-5 just expired, and we had the choice to turn it in, or keep it.  It was a no brainer.  It is still like new.  We kept it.,Good luck!",#60,,"Ohio, USA",NA,"Serial Entrepeneur, Restauranteur",66,40,

A nice looking car is always a nice looking car, any add-on, sure, it makes the car looks bettter, but we are comparing stock vs. stock, which is the fundamental.

New generation of BMW no longer matches the quality of German cars.  Just look at the paint and interior, will you pay that much of money ? I would not.  Bmw is becoming more jap car alike.,I am driving an audi TT here as you can tell from audi_ttc2001, but let me know you the truth of owning both brands.

Internal Combustion,Bugatti Veyron 16.4 vs. McLaren F1,post-395805,"Jul 13, 2009",sif,"There can be no doubt that both of these cars are masterpieces of engineering.  However their philosophies could not be more different.  The McLaren was conceived as the ultimate race-car for the road, which becomes clear when you hear stories about the fact that even the tool-kit was designed bespoke for this car in order to shave a few hundred grams. The car weighs about the same as an R56 Mini, but has 5 times the power, an incredible achievement.  This is borne out further when you look at its Le Mans record: a first, third, fourth, fifth and thirteenth place finish on its first entry was and still is unprecedented.  The Veyron on the other hand to me is the ultimate GT with a focus on headline figures.  That is no insult: what the Veyron sets out to achieve, it does better than any car that has ever existed.  To compare these two cars abilities is to sell both of them short.  In the same way the McLaren could easily out-corner the Veyron, the Bugatti crushes miles in comfort much better than the F1.  In the end, each person will prefer what suits their tastes and personalities more, but this wouldn't be a message board without a few differing opinions, would it?  For me there can only be one choice, 15 years on and it is still the benchmark that all sports cars aspire to.",#41,,Nelson UK,NA,Student,67,29,Nothing at the moment.

Internal Combustion,BMW M5 vs. Mercedes E63 AMG  Which is best?,post-217797,"Aug 13, 2007",ICM,"For the past few years, the German automakers have been in a civil war against one another. This is a civil war that is all about power – horsepower that is. The big three automakers, Audi, Mercedes, and BMW have been pumping out a continuous line of monstrous sedans and coupes across the line. But the main focus where this war is most violent is between the super sedans. Audi has a 500hp version of its A6 sedan called the RS6, and then there is the Mercedes AMG E63, and finally, the king of the super sedans, the BMW M5. Sadly however, the RS6 is no longer in the game since it is out of production at this time and won’t return for at least another year. However, the competition is still fierce between BMW and Mercedes.,Last year, BMW raised the bar yet again with its all-new M5. Previous M5s were nothing short of driving perfection and the absolute best sport sedans in the world – they were also the fastest as well. However since the beginning of this war of the German automakers, the M5’s 400hp was no longer enough. Mercedes’ E55 was pushing out 450hp with the latest E class body; then Audi blew AMG away with the stunning 500hp RS6. BMW wasn’t going to be left at the bottom of the scale, so while the M5 retired for a short time, BMW spent quite a while making sure their new M5 would be nothing short of perfection. With an all-new 507hp V10 this engine is a masterpiece of BMW engineering. The new M5 is a technological showcase as well. Its new SMG gearbox has seven gears, and up to eleven different settings that allow the driver to choose how fast he wants the car to change gears. This transmission is a clutch-less manual, with F1-style paddles on the back of the steering wheel to shift, and in addition it does also offer full-automatic mode. The SMG in the M5 is spot-on, and works very well in this car, unlike the way it performed in the older M3 and Z4. However, there is also a traditional six-speed manual available. In addition to the M5’s long list of techno-gadgets and settings, you can also select how much power the engine produces as well.,Mercedes responded promptly this year with a revised version of its E55, now named the E63. The change in numbers is prompted by an increase from the former 5.5L V8 up to a 6.3L V8 that now produces 506hp, and 464lb-ft of torque, which is just slightly more than the M5. The E63 now also has a seven-speed gearbox called 7G-tronic that, like the M5, has F1 style paddles on the back of the wheel that allows the driver to change gear. Unlike the M5 however, this gearbox is a proper automatic, and a complete manual transmission is not available because the E63’s torque would ruin any manual gearbox that Mercedes can make.,Performance wise on paper these cars are almost identical. They both have 0-60 times in under 4.5 seconds and have a limited top speed of 155 mph; and even so, unrestricted both will reach the exciting side of 200 mph. Both of these cars will also reach into the exciting depths of your bank account as well, both start at just over $81,000, and after options, you’ll be pushing nearly six figures for the MSRP. So there you have it, both of these cars are almost identical in just about every way. But how do they drive? I’ve luckily had a chance to drive both of these super sedans, and on the face of it, both of them are just fantastic. Behind the wheel of one of these, it’s easy to forget that you’re actually driving a comfortable four-door sedan because they’re just so fast.,The great thing about both of these cars is that once your finished with fooling around and smoking tires, they settle down, and become comfortable, great looking sedans that you can drive everyday, and hardly anyone will notice. The E63 is conservatively styled, and only the keen automotive enthusiast will regonize your driving something very special. The M5 on the other hand is a bit more aggressive. The base of the normal 5 series is a dramatic departure from the previous model and its not as conservative as before. Like Mercedes, the BMW styling changes are minimal, but it still is far more noticible on the highway with its large, deep-dish alloy wheels, and aggressive front fascia. It’s not as elegant as the Mercedes but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.,The E63 on the road is very well planted; you can immediately tell that this car was made for the autobahn. Its V8 has a great exhaust note, and its torque surge is addicting under acceleration. The torque that this engine produces is just mind boggling, and it thrusts you into your seat as the traction control light flashes helplessly to try to keep the tires in check. The great thing about the E63 is that this is a very forgiving car. Mercedes has packed it full of electronics and traction control systems to keep you from loosing control. However, these are almost impossible to completely turn off, and for the experienced driver, they really take away from the driving experience. However, the most disappointing part about the E63 is that the steering is much like that of other E-classes; it’s rather numb and lacks feel. It’s heavier than in other models, and it handles well, but the entire time you still somehow feel distant from the car. Added with all the electronic gadgets that work with this vehicle (which is well over 100 different systems and computers) you don’t feel like you’re the one driving this car anymore.,In comparison, the BMW M5 is a bit more brutal in its driving experience; that is of course once you get around the iDrive system, and its driving aids as well. Like the Mercedes, this BMW is packed with just as many electronics and traction control systems to keep this car in check. This car is easily one of the most frustrating vehicles to figure out. Yes, it is a technological showcase, but the automated voice from the navigation system doesn’t shut up, and it always talks over your favorite radio station, which you can’t find anyway because its too complicated, the climate control systems are a nightmare to work properly, and you even have to select how much power you want the engine to produce. This takes forever to adjust all these settings, because they are far too difficult and distracting to do while your driving. Of course, once you get used to it and get your settings all dialed in, you can forget them and don’t have to bother with them again, but its still a hassle regardless. The good thing however is there is a way you can get around all this mess if your in a hurry. Located on the steering wheel is a button that just says “M”. Push this, and the engine produces its maximum amount of power, the traction control is switched off, the suspension goes into attack mode, and the gearbox is switched over to manual. That also activates the unique heads-up display that gives you a color-coded rev-counter and speedometer. The engine barks out a fantastic exhaust note, and once I floored it, this car violated me – personally. The seats squeezed my sides in, and it took me by surprise because this wasn’t a gentle squeeze. The first corner I took, the side bolsters push into your sides to keep you from sliding around, and I’ll tell you what, it gives you one heck of a driving experience. This car is hands down one of the most exhilarating cars I’ve ever driven, and under full throttle, it just makes your heart stop, I couldn’t believe how fast it was. This car put a huge smile on my face in a way that the E63 just doesn’t. That doesn’t mean the E63 is a bad car, but it feels more like an executive car, and you just want to cruise in. The M5 on the other hand is just bonkers, and it’s mad; it wants you to trash it and drive it like your hair is on fire.,Overall, both of these are great cars. But once you get around the complications of the BMW’s iDrive system, it delivers a driving experience that the E63 will never do, and for that reason, I’ll take the M5 every time.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,3,7,"BMW M5,316i,E320,Prado VX8"

Internal Combustion,BMW Concept Vision Efficient Dynamics vs Porsche 918 Spyder Concept,post-552475,"Dec 20, 2011",mohsin,"The BMW twin turbo diesel technology in my view is better conceived though I have reservations about its execution.I like the concept of converting the kinetic energy generated from brakes to  electrical energy, hence charging the batteries consistently,when the car is running in hybrid mode.Further ,given that the car has just three cylindersand the amount of  power that it generates is commendable. The elecrical charging system in the BMW s concept car isclearly better than the Porche 918 spider.However the Porche is clearly ahead of the BMW when it comes to stanstill speed which for the bmw is 100km|hr in 4.8 secs while the Porche just takes 3.2 secs.Also for all its creative technology the BMW loses to the porche in fuel consumption which is a phenomenal 3 litres per100 km as opposed to BMW s 3.76 litres.The fuel consumption is phenomenal in the porche because as opposed to the BMW it has a V8 engine  and higher speed 320km per hr .The co2 emmisions while a bit higher on paper 70grams per km of the porche are actually very good considering the power it generates.,If I were to choose between the two,Id go for the Porche Spider 918",#22,,NA,NA,NA,8,0,

AND, we're all former E60 M5 owners.  This tells me that a number of well informed BMW people have made the decision to purchase the GTS instead of the F10 M5.  I gave up my 'first in line' spot at the dealer.,I do think these cars are real competitors because:,1. Their pricing is similar.  Yes, the GTS is some $15K more, but it's in the 'buyers range' for a car like this.,2. Yes, the M5 will blow the panny away in a straight line test.  But I think the panny will hold it's own on the track.  Sport Auto had a 1:13.5 time in sub-freezing temperatures vs a 1:12.9 time for the M5 in ideal conditions.  I'll bet their track times are very similar, and that means the GTS must handle way better, given the 130HP deficit it's making up.,3. Yes, some say the panny is ugly, and the M5 is definitely better looking from most angles.   But at least the panny looks like a 4-door $100K super car.  The M5 looks like a tricked out 5-series, and might just be too 'subtle'.,4. The interior of the Panny is one of the best of any car available.  The bimmer is better than the E60, but doesn't measure up to the panny.,5. The M5 has the most ridiculous feature of any car in the last 20 years - PRE RECORDED PIPED IN EXHAUST SOUND, because the natural engine noise doesn't get through the cabin.  The panny has both the 'sport exhaust' and the 'sound symposer' - fantastic solutions to having a quiet car when you want it, but having a sports sound when you want that.,6. The panny is AWD.  Big advantage in the snow belt, and a much more practical car for driving long-distances when you don't know what the weather will be.,So, I think the GTS is the better car.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,25,11,

I've test driven all of these. Jag XF gave me the best feeling, and I'm a guy who has always thought Jags were for silvery cads and bank robbers. Audi is aesthetically boring, unrefined at high speed, FWD and just feels strangely unwieldy. The E class isn't even at the races - it has a strangely offset steering wheel, cheap feeling dash, looks boxy and doesn't handle. The Bimmer comes second - but its huge, the handling is unengaging and the cabin is awash with the kind of cheap plastics you'd expect to find in a Hyundai (I could hardly believe it when I sat in it, what are BM doing?). All the German cars have a certain unholy combination of being aggressive yet simultaneously average to behold - I think it's the angular lines and black everywhere in the interior that does it. I loved the Jag, the ride was amazing, it was refined at high speed, handled very well. I don't particularly care that a 7 footer might bump his head in the rear seat, and I don't care about the 4mpg extra a 520d gives me over an XF2.2 L - the XF 2.2d is faster and if I've got enough money to spend on one of these cars those kind of differences don't even touch the sides. No - the reason the Jaguar is the best is because they've understood why people buy these kind of cars and not a VW, a Prius or a Mondeo. The decision to purchase is not an exercise in ticking boxes, unless you're a fleet manager, and Jaguar have been quite clear they're not interested in that market anyway, even with their 4 pot diesel XF.,In short Jag have really hit the sweet spot with the XF. It won't be the doyen of executive fleets, that niche will remain with Audi and BM, but let them have it. Fleet sales don't make profit and they don't add to the desirability of your motor. Fleet sales have made Audis and BMs 2 a penny, and are the reason those marques have gone down market. Jaguar remains a luxury sports car manufacturer, the XF is already a classic and the reasons to buy one are as emotional as they are rational - just how it should be.........",#67,post: 533040,NA,Male,NA,1,2,

Internal Combustion,DCT vs Manual,post-610574,"Dec 2, 2012",jkrutch,"I think it is totally car dependent.  I've been fortunate to have some amazing cars in my garage over the last several years (and drive a few I didn't own), so I can speak from experience to a few.  In 2005, I purchased my first Gallardo and it was a manual tranny. I was initially concerned over the gated shifter, but loved the car enough to pull the trigger anyway.  It was what I was accustomed to...a sports car with a manual.  I learned to love the gated shifter quickly.  That was my last manual car.,My first DCT car was the then new GT-R that I got in Aug 2007.  The upshifts were great, the downshifts were fine if I wanted 1 gear, but that tranny could not downshift more than 1 year at a time.  With 2 rapid clicks of the downshift paddle, 99% of the time I would get one gear.  Overall I was unimpressed with that DCT unit.  Not sure if it has changed over the years.,Fast forward to 2009.  I moved up to the LP-560 with the e-gear tranny.  It is a single clutch tranny, but it blows everything else I have driven out of the water.  It grabs gears with ferocity and on downshifts, 3 rapid clicks = 3 gears of downshifts instantaneously.,A few weeks ago I was invited to drive the McLaren at Homestead Motor Speedway.  It was a marketing exercise to ""introduce"" the MP-12 to current owners of competitive makes.   The DCT unit in the McLaren (even in track mode) lacks the positive shift feel of the e-gear in the Lambo.  The overall performance is definitely superior to the aging Gallardo, but the fun factor (due mostly to the tranny) is still better in the Lambo.  One other ""quirk"" in the McLaren...the left and right paddles are connected in the center of the steering wheel.  I am not sure why.  That took some getting used to for sure.,At the end of my long-winded post, I would still vote DCT.  I am over manual gearboxes.",#20,,NA,Male,NA,3,0,

Internal Combustion,Maybach vs Mercedes - UHSS vs regular steel,post-502388,"Feb 18, 2011",ObsessedWithCarSafety,"Hi, came across this thread after Googling for boron / HSS / car safety.,As much as I'd like to believe that M-B is constantly pushing ahead with regards to safety, and is ""obsessed"" with making the safest car possible, (as my username states, I'm obsessed with car safety myself), I'm not so sure it's true.,For example, check out the IIHS,for the 2007 E class. Not so good. Sure, the,does much better, with the B-pillar intruding much less (by 16.5 centimeters to be exact), but still... if M-B were constantly pushing ahead and so focused on safety, shouldn't at the very least a 2007 model excel in the side-impact crash test? Even the 2005 Audi A6 beat out the 2007 Mercedes by about 5cm. As did the 2006 Volvo XC90 (which is the exact same car as the 2003 XC90, I'm almost positive).,Also, while we're on the topic of side impact crashes: I hate how the IIHS's side-impact test uses a 3,300 pound barrier that's the size of the front-end of an SUV. Why is it so light? 3,300 pounds is lighter than a lot of cars (the E class weighs at least 400 more than that)... a VW Jetta weighs about 3.3K pounds. And most SUVs are at the very least 4K pounds, if not 4.5-5K. In my opinion, the barrier's weight should be increased by about 1K pounds in the near future, and the impact speed should be increased a bit too (currently it's at 31MPH). Doing so would cause just about every car on the market to fail the test. Which is a good thing.,My hunch -- and I could be wrong -- is that the reason why the barrier is so light, is that they may figure that if they set the bar too high too soon, then the car makers will be less likely to improve performance in side impact crashes. But now that so many cars are passing the test, I say now's the time to raise the bar.,But anyway, I'm still looking forward to seeing what kind of safety improvements Mercedes and other companies will be making in the future.

Internal Combustion,Jaguar F-type R coupe vs. Porsche 911 Turbo S,post-697583,"May 27, 2014",afako,"The first thing to understand is that the new Jaguar F-type R coupé truly belongs in this kind of company. When the convertible arrived last year, we fretted about its pricing proximity to the Porsche 911 – and its distance from the,.,Our fondness for Jaguar’s V8-engined roadster is a matter of record, but having it go toe to toe with a,would be folly. For all the ability plumbed into its clever aluminium bedrock, the,is as much hedonistic hot rod as it is honest-to-goodness sports car.,The coupé, though, particularly in range-topping R format, is a different prospect. Closing the roof has sewn up the monocoque’s soft spot with the thoroughness of a Roman stonemason sliding the keystone into an arch.,The resulting structure has been made positively triumphal by the addition of yet more power. Its 542bhp is as much as has ever been extracted from Jaguar’s all-aluminium V8 – 54bhp more than the V8 S rag-top  and an output previously reserved for the weightier XKR-S and XFR-S.,By transplanting it into the 1650kg F-type and keeping the price below six figures, Jaguar has one of the world’s most formidable sports cars in its sights the Porsche 911 Turbo S. If that weren’t enough, it’s also May and the sat-nav says south Wales – home of the British monsoon. Welcome to big school, Jaguar.,Fortunately for the F-type, the introductory 100-mile M4 handshake offers the Porsche little opportunity to administer a Chinese burn. The weather is dry, the sun is out and the R dispenses feelgood like a Balearic terrace DJ.,This car is exceptionally beautiful. That must be agreed before we go anywhere. The proportions, very slightly fudged in the convertible, are now exquisite. Were this a beauty contest – and it will be for some – the winner could easily have been decided inside the M25.,The F-type coupé’s roofline contributes to the interior prowess, too, forming a haunched set of shoulders aft of the excellent seats.,Then there’s the sound. We’re used to Jaguar teasing some extraordinary notes from the outboard-mounted quad pipes, but this time it has gone to Liberace levels of excess. In Dynamic mode, the bypass valves default to straight-through drama at all speeds, meaning that every inch travelled is accompanied by an ear-splitting eight-pot mewl or off-throttle pop.,It is of such melodramatic, look-at-me quality that you’d most likely shy away from extolling its virtues in the company of others – and then leave it permanently turned on when alone.,As with its appearance, the bombastic soundtrack leaves its rival trailing. The far more expensive 911, on its widest available track with 305-section rear tyres and retractable wing, looks as imposing on the road as it does on a spec sheet.,But the 552bhp twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre flat six stays resolutely buttoned down, transporting you from standing start to beyond the horizon with the expediency of a flash drive.,Refined progress comes naturally to the Porsche. It would permit you to absent-mindedly study the concrete pylons on the Second Severn Crossing at 150mph. Its high-speed stability is remarkable, and the way that it simmers intimately on adaptive dampers and 20-inch wheels is testament to the engineers’ intentions for its use.,However, strike a swollen catseye or the wrong type of crease and the Porsche’s chassis will momentarily bridle. The Turbo’s ride quality is a tightrope act designed to stay bolt upright on varnished autobahns, but a cruddy British motorway is not beyond upsetting the balance.,The F-type, as you might expect from a car tweaked a stone’s throw from the M40, is better equipped to deal with our arterial patchwork. Not for it the over-sprung twang of wheel meeting impediment. This is a Jaguar, after all, and it rides like one.,The resulting lope is an essential element retained from the roadster but, with telltale tremors gone, more obviously honed. A marginal raising of spring rates doesn’t stop the R from riding better in Dynamic mode, though, the extra body control adding directness to its lane changes and steeling the car against irresistible changes in pace.,Interacting with the V8’s 502lb ft via the exceptional ZF-supplied eight-speed automatic gearbox turns out to be so invigorating that a gap opens organically from it to the chasing pack, and the F-type is first through the toll gates and into Wales – and, correspondingly, half a length ahead in the running order by the end of the first day’s play.,Day two takes us to the countryside north of Sennybridge and into the opening salvo of showers, each a mobile, malicious fog of Brecon perspiration. First up on this slippery proving ground is the Porsche, spinelessly chosen for the steadfastness displayed 24 hours earlier. In that respect, it doesn’t disappoint. Only a corpse would claim to be totally unmoved by the first hyper-extended knee bend of the morning, and the way that the Turbo shifts this straight-line thrust into lateral forcefulness is initially baffling.,Iron will plays its part. The chassis, and its colossal footprint, are presented to the driver almost as agents of obstinacy. Channelled by heavy, direct steering and with adaptive suspension that permits almost no body roll at all, you fire into bends with the dynamic engine mounts bolted down, 553lb ft of torque (on overboost) furiously vectoring and, come the exit, as much power at the front as is being sent to the back.,There is adhesiveness, then, and giddying pace to go with it. But neither can alleviate the bloodlessness for which the Turbo is famous. Even with a damp, empty moor laid on, adjustability and playfulness are secondary concerns. Driving it is like embarking on army manoeuvres: all the wearing physicality of battle without any of the live ammo catharsis.,Through the Jaguar F-type's seatbacks, there’s the sense of a less tenacious hold on the road without a driven front axle to share the drive burden, and where moisture persists, the traction shortfall is obvious. But, in contrast to the open-top V8 F-type, there’s a kernel of firm confidence in everything that the new coupé does.,Its unremitting power delivery no longer seems daunting. Flooring the convertible could feel like a dicey exercise, but in the R coupé, for all its wheel-spinning potential, the even higher output seems tailor-made and keenly deployable. Having more faith in the monocoque’s ability to harness the source of all the evocative noise is key and, as the miles rack up, the car’s exuberance begins to tell.,The lightly fettled steering, superficially insubstantial, becomes meticulous when pushing on. Sitting, as you do, just forward of the F-type’s rear axle, such accuracy is essential to allowvyou to position the long nose that bit more sweetly.,From there, in almost any corner imaginable, the beautifully resolved chassis takes over. Best experienced with some of the electronic shackles loosened (TracDSC readily obliges), the R flaunts its sublime front-engined, rear-drive balance at every opportunity, clamping you to an apex only for as long as you desire before a slither of extra throttle has the biddable back end changing attitude.,If that sounds like the reactiveness granted to any grunty rear-drive car, think again. The subtlety and obedience of the breakaway isn’t far short of astounding. And as the R, via its second-generation E-diff, is so good at telegraphing its whereabouts, you’re free to dip in and out of the excess as much as you like.,That choice is at the heart of what makes the car so special. Its all-wheel-drive rival wants you to make its engineered statement of intent come true. The faultlessly fast 911 Turbo wishes to function as the ultimate salve to the contemporary headache of A to B.,Not once does the Jaguar stop feeling like an event. It’s easy to get carried away when it can barely be got into, or out of, without a moment being taken to reappraise just how unspeakably pretty it is, but its specialness isn’t diluted by either a traffic-clogged return journey or the distance of retrospect.,Its huge, atmospheric pace and rousing handling at one end would be less remarkable were they not mingled so keenly with a sense of genuine companionability at the other.,It is that breadth of ability and the almost quixotic insistence that you enjoy yourself at every turn which makes the F-type R coupé not only the most compelling sports car on sale but also one of the best, period.,£85,000,4.2sec,186mph,25.5mpg,259g/km,1650kg,V8, 5000cc, supercharged, petrol,542bhp at 6500rpm,502lb ft at 3500rpm,8-spd automatic,£140,000,3.1sec,197mph,29.0mpg,227g/km,1605kg,6 cyls horizontally opposed, 3800cc, twin-turbo, petrol,552bhp at 6500-6750rpm,516lb ft at 2100-4250rpm,7-spd dual clutch automatic",#1,,NA,Male,NA,7,8,

Internal Combustion,BMW G11/12 7-Series Vs. Mercedes-Benz W222 S-class Photo Comparison,post-750923,"Jun 12, 2015",ogedike,"The W222 is a clear winner for me but that's not to say the G11 isn't an impressive machine in its own right. Both cars are evolutions of their predecessors with the BMW being the one which is much more improved from its own (the F01 was very underwhelming to me and although I liked the E65 for how revolutionary it was, public opinion seems to defer greatly).,The exterior of the G11 has an aggressive and sporty look and its interior is clean and modern whilst embodying a good sense of luxury, in other words, it's a quintessential BMW. However, when I think of this segment, the word ""luxury"" first comes to mind, and luxury should supersede every other thing. If I want a sports version of a car in this segment, I'd like to have that option but that's not what I look for here.,The W222 wins for me because it strikes the perfect balance as it juxtaposes bourgeois luxury with a futuristic and minimal idea of luxury, doused in a huge dose of technology. This in turn makes it a brilliant tour-de force for the present. The interior is striking and is IMO, simple. Considering the amount of things that can be done in the car, the buttons are indeed sparse in number. There's also a sense of presence and aura that I don't think the G11 can match, although I'd reserve judgement until I see it in person.,It is this balance, that I think will always give the W222 an edge and make it a worthy competitor to the Bentley Flying Spur and perhaps the Rolls-Royce Ghost. There are a billion W222's scattered all over London but any time one passes by me, I just can't help but stare and feel it's presence. Even after 2 years since its launch, it's still the luxury benchmark for me. If I had the money, it wouldn't be a difficult choice.",#92,,NA,Male,NA,10,59,

Internal Combustion,BMW G11/12 7-Series Vs. Mercedes-Benz W222 S-class Photo Comparison,post-752537,"Jun 23, 2015",Carmaker1,"This is very hard for me, as I like to be as objective as possible. I was the grandson of a BMW man (importer) and still the son of a BMW gal (and Jaguar guy), but greatly in love with the W222. I have never personally had an S-Class in my immediately family growing up nor personally owned anything in this class for myself. I've grown up with the 7-Series since the E38 and my maternal grandfather owned an E32 as his last BMW.,By extended family and friends, I've come into contact with the various generations of S-Class here and there, but never at home. My father does not like Mercedes-Benz (except Geländewagen) the way the rest of his family does and prefers British makes (especially Jaguar) above everything, with the exception of Audi.,I love both brands for their own respective qualities, but will try to be honest. The amount of technology and refinement packed into the G11 certainly takes the 7er forward, but will this design last 7 more years is the question?,My only gripes with the G11 is the shaping of the headlights (they look swollen) and the dash design similarity to the F30. Even the E38 and F01 dash designs did not closely resemble that of the E36 and E90, the way the E32 and G11 have with the E30 and F30 respectively. The way the make up for this, is in the attention to detail, and superior fit & finish for their respective eras.,I talked with my mother about this and we both believe that some aspects of the S-Class are too overdone, while BMW has also underdone the G11 in some ways. Does not really matter anyway, as she will never buy an S-Class saloon over a 7er.,I had much more to say on this specific topic, but cannot really remember anymore. I am usually indecisive, that I'd honestly take both if I was in her position! You can't go wrong with either. As some of you said below, it is all about subjective taste.,That's how my father has always looked at things and has never really liked what Mercedes-Benz has to offer, except for the Geländewagen. He's strictly been about British autos and Audi, except when practicality and versatility is a factor. However, he has never liked the current XJ, but does like its replacement (a reason I will not want/need one). Again, I have no favourites of course. I am not too fond of Maserati, but they are still decent.,Well, that isn't quite fair to say, but I do agree somewhat. Some people are too badge-biased to the point, that Jaguar does not even get a chance and automatically render it inferior. This is ""German Car Forum"" not ""British Car Forum, so it's understandably expected.,We do not exactly have the most resources to work with and brand cache like BMW and Mercedes-Benz do, so we've done what we can on gambles. Outside of BMW Individual, there have been some areas where BMW doesn't surpass Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz has only fully flourished as of late.,I can see why I post less here, as I am not an argumentative person, and quite tired of the endless digs thrown at Jaguar. GCF is still very much more objective, compared to many other sites, that would give me a migraine.,Oh really? We'll see about that then, as you're very unaware how we're in the middle of development on a very large project at the moment and the current XJ (X351) is not eternal nor fully representative of our best work under less limitations.,It is very helpful seeing what the W222 and G11 have to offer, but we've already made our own plans as well with substantial investment. If we are,, then I might as well as join the unemployment queue.,Robert Lešnik came to Mercedes-Benz in January 2009 and Karim Habib in March 2009, both towards the end of the W222 design process. Habib was in Advanced Design (influenced F800), with Lešnik somehow inserting himself into design of the W222. For the life of me, I cannot understand why both Lešnik and Mark Fetherston are continually given credit nearly every new MB's exterior design. Are they that good?,Il-hun Yoon was responsible for the W222 exterior, yet has been shoved into the background for mysterious reasons and late comer Lešnik getting the sole credit, when Yoon was still working on 1:1 W222 clay models in 2009 and did much of the sketches priorly. What did Lešnik do that was so spectacular and differentiating from Yoon's suggestions, that gave him such credit so last minute?,Yoon Sketch,Lesnik Post-Design Freeze Sketch,It's not so much Daimler/Chrysler era, but simply Peter Pfeiffer. When he got overall control in 1999, plus mixing the recent merger, things became a blocky mess. The W222 design was one of the first fully approved under Wagener 6 years ago and one he was allowed several months to oversee, compared to the CLS (C218).,Considering that Wagener designed the W221 himself in 2001, it is no wonder the transition from W221 to W222 went so well. Habib was promoted too late to preside over the G11 design process. The F800 was developed in 2009 for Geneve 2010 and looks to showcase Sensual Purity more.,One cannot solely blame Chrysler for Daimler's prior failures, they were both bad for each other. I have heard both sides of the story and neither is innocent. I do agree that Chrysler caused them to lose focus, as it was an unnecessary headache to additionally manage. Both companies were headed down the same path by 1993, thanks to Robert Eaton of Chrysler destroying Iacocca's visions and McKinsey's & Company's cost-cutting influence on Daimler-Benz.,The C218, W166, and X166 are of the ""Aqua Dynamic"" theme in my own opinion. The C218 and W166 were both frozen around the same time in 2008, while the GL followed after in 2009. Much of the design for the C218 was laid out in 2007 and probably the W166 as well.,The W222 was finished in 2009 and W205 in late 2010. The odd thing about the CLS is, that it underwent changes between design patent filings in June 2008 and the actual product was more angular. The Huckfeldt leak in May 2008 was 100% correct, but MB changed it up a bit by 2010.,Looking at the timing, Wagener was probably not allowed much leeway with aspects of the GL. He did barely take over in June 2008. I had said in the past on here, that the W212 was frozen in 2006 and X204 sometime in 2005. Pfeiffer's deep influence didn't really surface until about 2004, as no redesigns were launched in 2003. The W211 E-Class I've learned, was moreover a Sacco-influenced design and the R230 SL is also his through and through (June 16, 1997 sign-off).,When someone takes the lead post and has a different design idiom, their vision might take awhile to have proper effect. Peter Schreyer took over Hyundai design nearly 2.5 years ago and none of the recent redesigns were influenced by him. His supposed ""Bauhaus"" C5 A6 launched in 1997, was actually designed under Harmut Warkuss in 1991-1992 and frozen in June 1994. Schreyer took over Audi Design afterward in October 1994, yet is wrongly credited for that car. The TT was his first Audi and B6 his first saloon.,In many ways that is true, but Daimler also forced Chrysler to spend 40% less on their interiors, hence the terrible plastics that were used on their LX platform offerings from 2004-2010 and many other Chrysler vehicles. It was a very complex situation, but I am too tired to remember both sides fully. The end result has been like a bitter divorce, where ""friends"" of each have differing viewpoints.,Bear in mind that the E84 X1, while designed under Adrian van Hooydonk as BMW Brand Design director in 2006, Bangle was also BMW Group Design director back then. I cannot honestly vouch for how things changed, when van Hooydonk assumed his role in February 2004 and Bangle became formally in charge of all BMW Group Design.,I presume he had a say in how things were done, until departing 5 years later. Bangle's previous role (AvH's current role) as ""Group design chief"" is a unique one, as Ian and Gerry primarily do their work independent of each other at JLR. The F45/46 and F56 are very much of course recent stuff, so no argument there in being more subjective.,Well, he was definitely was there for the F10 and plenty more. When Bangle departed by February 3, 2009, BMW had already designed F07, E84, F10, F25, F12/13, and F20. The design for the F10 was chosen in December 2006 and frozen in mid-2007. Him leaving only had some bearing on future models (post-2012), as even the F30 was being designed back in 2008.,Lol! In some ways, that isn't too far off (no offense anyone). I always threw a fit whenever the latest thread post under the ""Mercedes-Benz"" section was ""Mercedes-Benz A-Class (W176)"", while I'm instead looking for W222/W205/C217/W213 spy shots and had to click further.,If he did, they were added very late in his tenure. I honestly would attribute those circular vents to the interior designer's visions, as plenty of Pfeiffer-directed designs have those. They just weren't on the level of the current style, that borrows more from English designs.,Quite unfair to pick on the X100 XK (and Jaguar in general), as that is very subjective and not really fact. I disagree about 1990s interiors, as you might as well include BMW interiors from the '80s as well. The E38, E39, and E46 were very good quality evolutions of their predecessors. MB took an unfortunate step-down in quality with obvious cost-cuts, while BMW worked their hardest to maintain profitability and improve on the E32, E34, and E36. Audi's only went up as well.,Some of it is because the F30 has been out for the 3.5 years and the G11 is just arriving, while the W205 C-Class was launched less than a year after the W222 S-Class. People have had plenty of time to get used to the 3er's design, while the S and C were nearly parallel, with the former preceding it. Audi was attacked for this greatly with the B8 A4 and D4 A8, which will not be an issue again with the D5 and B9.,My mother before even getting an invitation, was puzzled at the leaked winter shots and wondered why the G11 was not ""very different"" and ""took after a smaller car"". She is content now with it (due to features and etc), but still had to be convinced initially. She lives day-in-day-out with an F02 and has done-so for 5-6 years, so for her to feel that way begs the question.,Not quite, as the G11 design process began in 2010. The design was frozen about 3 years ago and design selection months before that. BMW most certainly was not starting the G11 design process as the F30 came out (Oct. 2011 prod, launch Feb. 2012), but were actually finishing up back then. It was essentially done by around June-July 2012.,The F15 design was reached in late 2010, if not Oct-November 2010 specifically, and by then the F30 was deep into testing. Much of the F30 was designed in 2008-2009, with proposal selection on March 2, 2009 and rapid design freeze in the following months.,The W222 is actually evolutionary (not revolutionary) in design, but differentiated enough from the angular W221 facelift through more organic shapes. The F01 was never particularly angular nor too organic, so the differences are not as obvious with the G11. I never really liked the W221 overall for that reason and preferred the F02. That's not to say it wasn't a wonderful car, as the level of quality improvement in the post-facelift W221 was excellent, while the original was a necessary stepping stone over the W220.,As for revolution, I think it will be the next 7er that will take that role. The E23, E32, and E38 were so similar, they're a family. The E65, F01, and G11 are a family of 21st 7ers. Not sure if what I'm saying makes sense.,Yes, pretty much the case here, even if the S-Class was out only less than a year before the W205 C. It is better in my opinion, for the flagship or halo model to lead the brand all the way. I am pleased that at Jaguar we have corrected this issue with next model, as the XJ just kept coming ""last"" since the 1990s (against XK, S-Type/XF, X-Type). Audi will do so as well with the D5, unlike the D4.,The 3-Series has always been a bridge between old BMW design and new BMW design. It helps keep the 3er fresh, while not taking away the shine from the flagship. Some people don't see it this way and automatically assume the 7 is an enlarged 3-Series. Only in the case of the E65, that this did not happen. There's nothing wrong with them being the same, but merely about hierarchy in the line-up. Top-down certainly does matter to a degree and Mercedes-Benz usually gets this right.,The difference is, the F30 has been in public long enough to make a lasting impression. The G11 is new and anyone who notices that, will make the correlation that ""7er copied the cheaper car"", similarly the way my mother did initially. Jaguar had this terrible problem 10-12 years ago, with the X-Type (2000-01) and X350 XJ (2002-03). Will not be happening, even if the XE has certain ""weaknesses"". The X760 (XE) successor will take after the redesigned XJ (X360), even though development has yet to begin on the former.,As you correctly said above, dimensions and perspective matter. Anyone that spots a 750Li and thinks it's a 318i, is clearly challenged. A C450 AMG Sport is far from being an S500.,What are you talking about? I'm not sure how these are particularly ""cheaper"". Maybe that applies to Mercedes-Benz more,-1995, but everybody else did very well in execution. Audi had its ascendancy for this very reason.,Audi V8 (1988-1991 version)-Cannot find any press shots,Audi V8 (1991-1994 version)-Dual Airbags, newer 4.2L,Audi A8 (D2)-A VAST improvement,You can't really say that is 100% correct (E65 copy), as the S-Class looks very oddly similar to a Japanese solution introduced in 1998. The same year BMW was designing i-Drive's layout and the E65 interior. Despite that, surely Mercedes-Benz were later on more focused on the E65, their closest competitor, rather than Nissan. How do you know the W221 was not frozen by the time the E65 was launched? It was very far along by December 2002.,Again, that is variable. Only the iDrive controller vs COMAND knob can be of question, as everything,have not come from BMW. BMW's screen placement solution may or may not been influenced by a Nissan interior from 1998 (designed in 1995).,I cannot properly speak for BMW, but the design of i-Drive interface in 1998 was an interesting story, but might've had prior influences of its own. It is Japanese automakers that came up with the idea for a higher screen placement, but BMW has full credit for the idea of a centre console-mounted control knob for the infotainment system on the E65.,Toyota was the first automaker to implement an infotainment screen at eye-level for,, in January 1998 on the 100-Series Land Cruiser. Much of the design development for that was done between 1991 and mid-1994. Again, Nissan takes the credit in terms of screen set-up, not overall interface.,The Nissan interface handled audio, climate, communication, parking assist camera, TV, and GPS functions. That iDrive interface was a pioneering effort for BMW that influenced the marketplace, but one can see who is closer to the Japanese design and it isn't BMW.,The '90s Japanese interfaces are definitely inferior to iDrive, as the Toyota system was solely touchscreen and not fully housed with the instrument clustre. The Nissan controller knob was too small and too far away to operate. However, all somewhat give an idea of independent progression towards better ergonomics. Audi's MMI took a different approach, being mostly developed parallel to iDrive from 1997 to 2000.,Looking down at touch screens below the steering wheel was no longer favourable for driving conditions, such as the case in the E38, LS400, A8 (D2), W220.,As I said to klier, no it was not. The E65 only pioneered the infotainment system and use of a centre console-mounted controller knob, but the massive screen housing was a template already developed by Japanese automakers in the mid-1990s. The W221 and W222 COMAND screen placement resembles the Nissan example, more so than BMW's E65 i-Drive monitor placement. Not many cars have exactly copied the BMW set-up per se, if BMW was not first.,Ironically, the same individual,designed both the W222 (2009) and W205 (2010). As we've seen, the W205 still took quite some work.,The S Coupe concept looked so sexy (oh god yes it did!) with that fully upright shark nose, as that is the only element missing on the C217. Clearly the production C217 was designed years before it, so it was too last minute. Hopefully they are implementing it for the C217 facelift in 2018.,Of course, the ultimate and original shark nose is this.,That is specifically your subjective taste, which is quite good (based on those beautiful examples), but other's ideas of ultra luxury are not necessarily inferior.,The Germanic interpretation isn't the end-all, be-all. Everything is very subjective, as some people feel German interiors are ""cold"" and ""clinical"", compared to ""warmer and more inviting"" English interiors. The W222, W205, and C217 have eliminated this to a degree. BMW has also done very well with the G11, by adding certain ""touches"" to it for once, especially in Individual trim. In fact many BMW interiors are improving significantly via better material selection and accenting.,Also, the idea that the Japanese somehow use ""plastic"" or ""shiny"" wood is quite an unfair, if not heavily biased opinion. One has seen many odd interpretations from German offerings alike.,No, you're actually not. My father purchased one in late 2005 and still owns it till this day. It resides with my sister in Georgia now. Wonderful car, but it's unfortunately the ""best"" XJ interior of this generation (X350) and that apparently isn't saying much. The '09 SV8 Portfolio (X359) that joined it temporarily, his last Jaguar purchase, is nothing special. Reaching 10 years old, it is very reliable and the best example of that generation all-around.",#312,"post: 751000,post: 751008,post: 751041,post: 751009,post: 751133,post: 751147,post: 751157,post: 751167,post: 751168,post: 751256,post: 751266,post: 751491,post: 751675,post: 751676,post: 751721,post: 751724,post: 751736,post: 751825,post: 751841,post: 751860,post: 751935,post: 751943,post: 751953,post: 752065,post: 752020,post: 752010,post: 752053,post: 752154,post: 752178,post: 752359",UK,Male,NA,535,"1,041","'08 LR Defender 90 SVX,E9x M3s (2011),'10 SVT Raptor SCab,'14 Ford SVT Raptor SE (US: 12/14),'16 Jaguar F-Type S Coupe 6MT,'18 F82 M4,'19 Ford Raptor Supercrew 802A,'19 M760i xDrive,'20 GT350,Many oth,2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited V6 (US: Jan - Aug 2007,stolen)"

All too often, manufacturers quote a car's ""dry"" weight (without driver, fluids, or fuel), a metric which bears no resemblance to its weight in working order.,Calculating a car's operational weight from its dry weight requires that you have a copy of its owner's manual at the ready, in addition to relevant product literature about its various coolants, fluids and oils. This may seem insignificant, but the difference between a test weight and dry weight can be as much as 200 kg (a driver and a full fuel tank account for roughly 140 kg alone); without knowing it, we might be comparing vehicles unfairly.,Luckily, magazines regularly measure a vehicle's weight for road tests; the result is a more realistic picture of kerb weight. Unfortunately, stark differences between magazines can muddy the waters of our understanding. In the following example, extreme differences in reported kerb weight can be seen:,Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera,: 1592 kg (700 kg front, 892 kg rear),: 1484 kg,: 1542.8 kg (658.6 kg front, 884.2 kg rear),: 1493 kg,The biggest discrepancy is a whopping 98 kg! Most would assume that surely these magazines use different methods for measuring/reporting vehicle kerb weights; a valid assumption were it not for the fact that these same tests were conducted for the Ferrari 458 Italia, which led to the following numbers:,: 1528 kg (651 kg front, 877 kg rear),: 1544 kg,: 1544.0 kg (657.2 kg front, 886.8 kg rear),: 1540 kg,That's a maximum kerb weight discrepancy of just 16 kg, or just about about one percent. In this instance, the numbers are very consistent. The conclusion we should draw from the Ferrari 458 numbers is that the magazines use the same methodology for reporting or measuring weight - something which sits in stark contrast to the conclusions reached above.,Clearly, a car's measured kerb weight changes based on fuel level (at a density of 0.755 kg/L, a 90 L fuel tank accounts for about 68 kg of mass) and number of occupants (the agreed-upon standard appears to be 70 or 75 kg). I would therefore like to know exactly how these factors are controlled for in each magazine's measurements. For instance, the DIN standard for kerb weight measurements clearly specifies 90% fuel and no occupants; whereas the EU standard retains the same fuel level and adds a 75 kg driver.,If we can standardize these measurements, it would be enormously beneficial for making an accurate comparison between vehicles. As we determine each magazine's method of kerb weight reporting, I'll update the list below to reflect that.,: 90% fuel; no driver,: 90% fuel; 75 kg driver,Auto (Italy):,AutoBild:,Autocar:,Automobilismo:,Auto Motor und Sport:,AutoZeitung:,Car and Driver:,Quattroruote:,Road and Track:,Sport Auto:,Sport Auto (France):,*not the least of which is the fact that people frequently confuse weight with mass; the former is a force which results from a gravitational field, the other is a measurement of linear inertia.,: 90% fuel; no driver,90% fuel; 75 kg payload (68 kg driver, 7 kg luggage),Auto (Italy):,: 100% fuel; no driver,Autocar:,Automobilismo:,: 100% fuel; no driver,: 100% fuel; no driver,Car and Driver:,: 100% fuel; 100 kg payload (driver and instruments),Road and Track:,: 100% fuel; no driver,Sport Auto (France):,: 90% fuel; no driver,90% fuel; 75 kg payload (68 kg driver, 7 kg luggage),Auto (Italy):,: 100% fuel; no driver,Autocar:,Automobilismo:,: 100% fuel; no driver,: 100% fuel; no driver,Car and Driver:,: 100% fuel; 100 kg payload (driver and instruments),Road and Track:,: 100% fuel; no driver,Sport Auto (France):",#1,,San Francisco,Male,Mecanical Engineering Student,493,436,1996 Geo Prizm

Bentley,Bentley Mulsanne Picture Thread,post-404321,"Aug 18, 2009",XXXJAG,"I'm sorry, but this is terrible. And here's why...,Front-on, the fog lamps make the Mulsanne look as though it is crying (a reflection of how I feel about this design). For Volkswagen to create a resemblance with the Continental (considered below), the Mulsanne had to have circular headlights, but there is no justification for the fog lamps to be positioned where they are - it's messy and a lazy design. “Well, we can’t copy the Phantom, so let’s move them out to there. Oh, look, it’s 5pm – time to go home.” Perhaps those fog light tears are supposed to draw your focus down and away from the bonnet, where the conflict between the circular headlights and the trapezoidal bonnet creases is palpable. Circles and trapezoids? Who could possibly think that was a good idea?,From the front 3/4 view, the folly of the front headlights and driving lights is compounded by the horror of the front bumper - it's like a bottom lip that extends too far. This view also calls into question the haunches over the rear wheels, which is in conflict with the straight waistline that extends from the bonnet and beyond the B-Pillar.,From the side, the Mulsanne has the same profile as the Continental Flying Spur (which was a commercially-driven four-door Continental). And this reveals another problem - the car's waistline is too high and the roof too low. From a Bentley, you should be able to survey your domain, not be hidden away or excluded from the outside world. To look outside from the Mulsanne will be like trying to peer through a letterbox. Bentley owners should never be reduced to that – that’s what the servants are for.,And then there’s the rear 3/4 view. Please, lock up your children. Now. They've taken the rear of the Flying Spur, fattened the haunches, raked the rear windscreen and made the boot squarer. Yet this description does not capture the abomination that has resulted. Quite simply, it is hideous – it’s like a sprinter is about to start a race with a giant packet of cigarettes wedged down the back of their shorts. You wouldn't see it on an athletics track, and you shouldn't see it here. There isn't even an extended rear bumper for the end of the extended boot to descend into or take refuge - that wedged packet just ends halfway between two pieces of chrome, one of which is on the packet itself.,Let's be quite honest about what happened here - Volkswagen bought the Bentley brand to make and sell prestige vehicles. But rather than retain and embrace the styling that made Bentleys elegant and imposing, they've taken the design language from the Continental and tried to infuse it into the Arnage, the last bastion of British Bentley. And to try and pass this off as a true Bentley, Volkswagen has used a name from Bentley's rich history: Mulsanne. But in doing so, they have merely abused the name and the Bentley brand. They may as well have called it the Flying Arnage Spur.,If Volkswagen wanted to be a custodian of the Bentley tradition and heritage, they would not have done this. What they should have done was to start their own luxury brand, as Toyota did with Lexus, Nissan with Infiniti and Honda with Acura. This car will not appeal to people who understand and love the Bentley brand - it will appeal to people with money rather than sense and no concept of heritage. David Beckham has probably pre-ordered three of them.,Auf wiedersehen, Bentley.",#6,,NA,NA,NA,1,2,

Along with the largest display of contemporary Aston Martins ever seen at a Motor Show, two V12 Zagatos, both having completed their engineering sign-off at the Nürburgring 24 hour race, will be shown for the first time at a mainstream event.,Hand assembled at the company's global headquarters in Gaydon, England, the V12 Zagato is based on the highly acclaimed V12 Vantage and features a beautiful 'handcrafted' aluminium and carbon fibre body. Combining traditional craftsmanship and high technology, the V12 Zagato also boasts Aston Martin's most dynamic bonded aluminium platform and the power of the company's acclaimed 6.0-litre V12 engine producing 510 bhp (380 kW / 517 PS), and 570 Nm (420 lb ft) of torque.,Following extremely positive initial customer reaction, the V12 Zagato is being offered for sale at £330,000 GBP (excluding local taxes) and will go into strictly limited production of up to 150 cars in summer 2012. 50 years on from the introduction of the iconic DB4GT Zagato, Aston Martin and Zagato have collaborated to create this modern interpretation which remains true to the focus of craftsmanship, performance and exclusivity which underpinned the original collaboration.,Launched successfully in late May at the famous Villa D'Este Concours on Lake Como, Italy, the V12 Zagato saw off tough competition to be awarded the coveted Design Award for the concept and prototypes class. Just a week later, the V12 Zagato made its racing debut at the 53rd ADAC ACAS H&R-Cup VLN race at the historic Nürburgring racetrack in Germany. Following other appearances in the series, both prototypes of the V12 Zagato were entered into the gruelling 39th ADAC Nürburgring 24 Hour on 25/26 June, successfully amassing a combined 230 laps and over 3,700 miles of intense durability testing – both taking the chequered flag to maintain Aston Martin's 100% finish record in the race.,The first of the two V12 Zagatos being shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show, finished in its distinctive green livery is the full endurance race car concept specification as campaigned at the Nürburgring. The car, nicknamed 'Zig' by the factory team features a full aerodynamic package including front splitter, dive planes, large rear diffuser and spoiler designed to make the most of the Nürburgring's multitude of corners and lengthy straights.,The second of the cars, nicknamed 'Zag', was originally shown at the Villa D'Este before being converted into the same full racing specification as the sister car. Since the 24 hour race, Zag, has been returned to its original show specification which, although showing a racing car interior, has an exterior more representative of the exclusive road car currently offered for order. In addition to this, Aston Martin today releases the first conceptual illustrations of the road car variant that will go into production from mid 2012.,The pair of V12 Zagatos will join the Aston Martin stand at Frankfurt in September alongside the stunning One-77 supercar and the recently launched Virage and Vantage S",#19,,"Montreal, Canada",Male,Veterinarian,"8,433","8,864","2019 M640 GT, 2020 440ix cabrio, 2019 Ford 250, e-Golf,2008 M5"

Pros,Comfortable, very comfortable and easy to drive, steering is lighter, suspension softer in comfort but able to tighten it up in Sport+.,Great cruiser, easy daily driver but can be stepped up into a fast sports car.,Fast, very fast - not as exciting as the E63 and feels less torquey in low gears but still rapid,Inside - lovely, really nice,Tech - superb, love the wireless CarPlay, Sat Nav is best in business and much better intuitive infotainment.,2. Cons,Engine is a bit meh! Come on BMW, surely the noise of the engine is the easy bit! Not as noisy as it should be, AMG is a different class,Outside design - a touch boring, not bad but not as aggressive as the E63 which I love,Space/practicality - it’s big and boot space is not bad but compared to the E63, not as good as the AMG.,So pros and cons to each and I’m leaning towards the M5 as it ticks more boxes, especially comfort wise.,If I was just going to be on a track or motorway roads then the E63 probably swings it but in real life, I’m a somewhat middle age guy, got a family and will do a lot of driving on crappy roads and values his *ss comfort! The M5 felt like the more complete car, able to tick more boxes.,The only thing is, that bloody AMG engine is difficult to walk away from, god I loved it.......",#211,,NA,NA,NA,18,34,

Hyundai / Genesis,Hyundai Motor's Sensational N Vision 74 Concept Thrills at Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este 2023,post-1237961,Monday at 9:06 AM,GCF,"– For Hyundai Motor Company’s first-ever appearance at the prestigious Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este this week in Lake Como, Italy, Hyundai Motor exhibited its N Vision 74 concept, catching the attention of the world-famous classic car and prototype show’s guests.,First unveiled in 2022, N Vision 74 is a hydrogen fuel cell-hybrid ‘Rolling Lab’ from Hyundai’s high-performance N brand, with a design inspired by the 1974 Pony Coupe Concept conceived by legendary Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro.,Hyundai Motor uses ‘Rolling Labs’ to test and verify advanced technologies for future production models, supporting its ambition to become a leader in the zero-tailpipe-emissions future. N Vision 74 is a culmination of Hyundai’s heritage design, state-of-the-art technology and N brand’s emotional high performance, representing Hyundai N’s long-term vision for a sustainable high-performance future beyond electrification.,N Vision 74 was developed around a unique hydrogen fuel cell hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of battery motor and a hydrogen fuel cell system. Developed with priority on high-performance, it is capable of stable power output without the power degradation exhibited by EVs in low state-of-charge conditions. Combined with the 5-minute recharge time, this unique hydrogen fuel cell hybrid architecture explores its high-performance potential as a fully functioning Rolling Lab.,N Vision 74 features left and right independent dual motors on the rear wheels, boasting a power output of 680 PS and acceleration of less than 4 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h. Power is provided by an 85 kW hydrogen fuel cell stack on the front, a 62 kWh lithium-ion battery between the driver and the passenger, and two 2.1 kg hydrogen tanks on the rear to provide a driving distance of nearly 600 km.,Prior to its appearance at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, N Vision 74 appeared alongside a restoration of the Pony Coupe Concept at the Hyundai Reunion in Lake Como, celebrating the company’s first Heritage Project.,By exhibiting the retro-futuristic N Vision 74 at one of the world’s top three classic and concept car competitions, Hyundai Motor was able to call attention to both its design heritage and its vision for sustainable performance technology.,“Participating in Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este is a tremendous honor and speaks to Hyundai Motors remarkable journey to get here. Yet, there’s so much more to come,” said Luc Donckerwolke, President and Chief Creative Officer of Hyundai Motor Group. “The future we used to imagine is gradually becoming a reality. The car is transforming from a means of transportation to a mobility platform that extends our lifestyle. Hyundai will be at the center of this design transformation, taking inspiration from our legacy to pave the way for future forms of mobility.”,“It is a great honor to participate in such a prestigious event in Italy, the country that marked the beginning of our design heritage as we uncover the roots of Hyundai’s design DNA,” said SangYup Lee, Vice President and Head of Hyundai Motor Design Center. “N Vision 74 is a tribute to our past efforts and a declaration of our future, carrying forward the bold spirit of the Pony Coupe Concept into a futuristic design that realizes the dream of our engineers to create Korea’s first sports car.”,Dubbed an ‘Instant Icon’ at the 2022 TopGear.com Awards, N Vision 74 explores the balance between state-of-the-art-technology and heritage design. It elevates the daring attitude of the Pony Coupe Concept into a future-oriented Hyundai design. Its exterior styling reimagines the pure surface, dynamically proportioned profile and B-pillar of the Pony Coupe Concept while the driver-centric cockpit blends heritage elements and modern design, such as a digital cluster and analogue buttons.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,"35,768",983,

After looping it into the grass at about 140 on a long downhill bend, the writer was fairly certain he was gonna die!

Anyways I'm in the market for a new vehicle. I currently own a 2006 F-150 that has 150,000 miles and guzzles gas. Some weeks I'm driving more than 250 miles and the gas hurts my wallet. Also the truck is getting up there on miles and I'm worried that things are going to start breaking and costing me a good amount. I want to do about an even swap and think I can get around $10k for my truck. I've been looking at 2005 BMW X5 4.4 with about 90,000 miles, 2004-2005 Porsche Cayenne with 100,000 miles and 2009 Audi Q5 with about 100,000. I'm only looking to own this vehicle for about 2-3 years. Since I'm only going to own this vehicle for 2 or 3 years I'm not looking to throw thousands of dollars into it. With that being said I want a vehicle that can fit 5 people comfortably and has room for items such as hockey bags ect. I also want this vehicle to get decent gas mileage 15-20mpg would be fine. I'm hoping that there are some mechanics here that can help me with reliability. If you couldn't already tell, my main reason for posting this is to ask questions about the reliability of the three cars. I know this is a beamer forum so if people don't know about the Porsche or Audi thats completely fine.

Grille is big, but imo not oversized at all. Gives the car a more impressive look. Rear is very beautiful with very nice new lights. Love it. Ordered one to replace my current 7 from 2016. Changes are huge for the exterior. Interior somewhat less, however the fully digital display that you can arrange yourself is great and gives the car a complete different look and feeling behind the steering wheel. Also new software for the i-drive system, much more to customize...,When compared with Mercedes S, of which I had a W222 before I switched to BMW 7, BMW is more fun to drive imo. Interior is mostly a matter of taste, I found S great, same as I like 7. S gave me more a saloon feeling, materials look fine, but are more delicate. 7 is imo very classic German, comfy, robust and practical. Cannot say what I prefer, both are excellent for me.,Also regarding comfort, very comparable. Only sport setting on BMW is really sporty, it becomes a different car. Mercedes in sport setting is mainly about going somewhat higher in rpm. But when do you still use this sport option in daily traffic?,Discussion about who's best, 7 or S is mostly personal and mainly a matter of taste... I can only say both are fantastic cars, difficult to find something else if you're used to one of these two.,As a conclusion, new 7 is really impressive imo.",#311,,NA,Male,NA,32,137,

BMW,Buying my first car questions. BMW 3-Series 06 - 07,post-744891,"May 1, 2015",P91E,"Im looking to buy my first car, and am buying a used car. I've never owned a car before as I've spent many years battling illnesses. So looking for my first car I found out I could get something I would truly enjoy and like. The BMW 3-series is actually in my price range and with what I was looking for as my first car. I've always loved german cars and really like the design of the BMW's. In my area a 2006 and 2007 BMW 325 328 and 330 all vary around 10,000. With 90,000 to 120,000 miles on them. I want Black on Black if possible.,I wan't to know what the common problems are with the mentioned models and what the common yearly cost to maintain the car would be.,Also is Manual better for driving experience and control vs Automatic. Also do you save any gas ""I read that somewhere"" that's not a deciding factor though.,I am a small guy which is due to having had health problems at such a young age. I love german car's, and many other german things, I speak some german and have german ancestry plus I appreciate nice things on top of that, I believe if I can obtain something than I should go for it, I don't want to regret not doing or getting something I could have accomplished. So I want something to fit me. I do also like the Audi A4 but I kinda like the BMW look a bit more. Still not fully decided, I will once I get to take some for a Spin, but it takes an hour to get to where they sell them and so I have to wait till college is over for summer till I'll have the proper time.,A few non car related questions.,While I don't care what others think about me I do care for my safety.,Do people in BMW's face more chances of people trying to run them off the road.,Do BMW's get keyed more often than the american or japan cars ""non owner related"",Am I more likely to be jumped or attacked for having this car or driving it.,I want this car for me because I like it, its not to impress others or intimidate them.,I am 23 have a beard but am small and weak ""I'm changing that well the weak part"" and I'm great with technology. Plus I'm a do it yourself man. I can fix anything I put my mind to, I've renovated a bathroom and fixed many things let alone computers, I am the family IT. I am in college ""to obtain a Computer Science Degree"" to help getting me certified for what I've done for 15 years. So I will attempt to do what I can by myself but will find help when I know I can't do something.,Also any advice on questions I should ask and anything I should look for.",#1,,DFW,Male,NA,1,0,

If this car goes into production with that interior - they will no longer be known for 3 cuts of the same sausage - instead it will just be the same sausage.,While the outside is beautiful, modern, and a fresh take on BMW - I am really tired of BMW literally taking an interior from a completely different model and sticking it into another vehicle - the worst violator being the 1 series interior which was shoved into the F30.  I think its time BMW found a new head of interior design - this past generation of interiors have been boring, lifeless, and and unexciting.

The transition is quite interesting from the creases in the front into the side and then back down. The size of the car is hidden well in the press pictures, in fact it almost appears small.,Funny thing, the rear in some photos looks almost like an suv, the lights are bit big. I feel the rear might still stir up controversy. I am curious about the 2 different exhaust styles, must be the sporty swb vs the normal lwb. the hood crease does run into the corners of the grill.,the front looks aggressive with the grill although being large is not too large.,I wouldn't say the car went back to the old E38 style at all, in fact it feels like an evolution of the E60 then blown up into a larger 7er format. I still can't get used to the new rear, the older facelifted 7er has a good rear design.,I agree the rear lights are like the E32, but their shape mimics the front lights as mentioned on here before. In some angles the lights look too large in others, mainly dead on rear, they look fine, sporty and sleak.,The car will look nice in black and white. Overall I like it, not a massive leap like E38 to E65 but still distinct enough to know its a new 7er, but at times from far away you could mistaken it for a current 5er.,Ha I am tempted to modify the press photos with a different color, larger wheels and in black.,edit, the more I look at it, the more it grows on me.",#405,,NA,NA,NA,13,6,

I dont have a problem with Merc or Audi, but i feel their cars lack the emotion that BMW has so cunningly, led us to believe, that all their cars poses. Have a look at BMW road test for the past 5 years and you will realize that, not even the typical bmw traits like ""communicative steering"" exist anymore. Whats happening to the world?? The M3 has been such an iconic car for decades and decades, how can its prestige and reputation be so easily given away to amateurs like Audi and Merc? I mean these guys pride themselves in doing comfort and safety best. If they dont even specialize in handling, gr8 chassis etc, how can they produce an arguably a better car than the masters?????,(sighs) I havent driven the M3 yet, but Damn it why is it that i want everyone to love it?,Anyone else feel the same way?",#23,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

So a 4 star review on the first ever review is not what we exspected.,SO it is dissapointing I must admit to read this. I still think it will be an amazing car, however compared to the exciting & hugely entertaining E46 M3 I think I will now buy an E46 for at least £20,000 less! Based on buying a late 2005 M3 e46 for £30,000 against the £50,000 plus about £5K for extras! Seems like I am buying quite a bargain!,I'm open minded though, & hopefull it's not gone to soft.,Must admit though the E46 M3 was a very, very hard act to follow. It's still head above the rest based on FUN factor alone in my opinion, & that includes 911's, I have had 2 including a Turbo, also driven the New M5, yes very fast, but I hate the auto gearbox, the 335i was more fun & entertaining in my opinion & have to say the E46 M3 is more FUN, practicle, & great to look at, than all the others.",#26,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Since the 335i is ""indent order only"" basis here it's very hard to get one, my friend and checked out this import car dealer and were told that if we were willing to wait 2 335s were arriving straight from the pier. It turned out that we had to wait for a couple of hrs but it was all worth it. Apparently the units were sourced from the States, one was titanium silver and the other jet black. The one we rode in(silver) had the gray leather interior, poplar wood trim, active steering, power seats, type 189 wheels and HIDs as the main options. We agreed that the design was a big improvement over the sedan and the the interior quality seems better than the 5 series sold locally. When we took it out to have the a test drive with the owner of the dealership driving the acceleration was immense and the power delivery very linear. Virtually no turbo lag and the engine was already pulling hard at 1500rpm. The 6 speed sportauto with paddles was very responsive but the operation was a bit tricky since it didnt have the SMGs configuration for the paddles but boy we were the quickest out there. One thing that we also noticed was the ride was very good for 18s and runflats(our roads are worst than the UK!). The owner/seller said that he preferred the active steering over the standard setup, since he is said to have owned an E46 M3 and E39 M5 before i think he knows what he is saying. The biggest downside to it? We didnt have the money to take it home hehe bec the asking price was a hefty Php4.8M(US97000!)",#1,,NA,NA,NA,3,5,

Actually, MB was first with the concept of having all controls integrated into one unit. It was launched in 1997 as COMAND and was navigated around by twisting and clicking a knob on the COMAND unit. BMW raised the screen to eye level and moved the controller to the centre console with more integrated functions - so it is actually an evolution of the original MB concept...,Also, soft closing pneumatic doors on the S were later placed into the 7....,These are just a few items that spring to mind where BMW have copied MB.,Also, active headlights and night vision were actually first on American cars years ago, but they never got it 100% effective from a technical point of view - so BMW did not launch active headlights.

BMW,Estimate BMW M3 2008 Lease Payments,post-185972,"May 13, 2007",Demian,"Lease rates are arbitrary and if the car is limited and there is a waiting list, you can damn well be sure that BMW Finance has a nice large lease rate.  BTW - lease rates change every month, so, what is true one month for a lease rate, won't be true the next month.  My first guess is that if you put $10,000 down and leased an M3 - you might be around $1,000 'a month' lease payment, $350 a month in insurance, at least $120 a month in petrol - so, for a planning process, you'll need about $15,000 in your bank account and earn about $3,000 a month after taxes (take home) just to live frugally. BTW - when you lease you basically are agreeing to return the car in IMMACULAT shape.  Any wear and tear not covered by warranty is your responsibility.,I lease a 2006 BMW 330xi and I badly want the 335xi (or a 335i).  However, I will save up my money for a decently large down payment in two years for the 335xi.,Unless everything falls apart between now and then.  You can never tell.,My used BMW came from a lease assumption - I paid the original lessor $2,000 in cash, she signed over the lease agreement & papers and my monthly payment is $463 with local taxes.  After licensing the car, I was only $3,000 grand in on a car with 5,000 miles.  It isn't an M3 or a 335i but, I'm happy with it for now.",#9,,"Longmont, CO",NA,Sales,4,0,

BMW,Next generation 3-series,post-191355,"May 29, 2007",Munich_Motor_Mouth,"In my opinion the suggested future design of the 3-series is much more appealing than the current (both 2-door and 4-door) versions.  It seems BMW is coming back to its roots, in that a particular styling cue was carried through across model lines.  This was somewhat derisively referred to as a ""cookie cutter"" approach, but it has worked very well for Audi over the past few years.  Of course this works best when starting from the top, so that the smaller models benefit from the so-called halo effect.  Indeed, as far as styling in that segment is concerned, I find that both the Mercedes C class and Audi A4 line exhibit a smoother and more pleasant shape than BMW 3-series sedan.  One shouldn't underestimate design, because that's what people exhibit and admire when the car is parked in the driveway and therefore ist the most important factor with many people not so obsessed about engine technology or sporty handling.  Just imagine how much more successful BMW could be now if they hadn't gone off on the angular Bangle-style tangents.  What appeals to me less in the preliminary photos is the fact that parts of the rear light cluster are integrated into the rear trunk lid (really not necessary and much more costly) and those sharp side edges, which are more difficult for the stamping presses and more difficult to repair after inconsiderate people bang on them when opening their own car door in a parking lot.",#34,,NA,NA,NA,9,7,

Congratulations to Scott26 and EnI for raising my interest successfully here and elsewhere for the past months.,Yet, I'd like to point out one interesting point regarding the front and, especially the front lights of the new 1-Coupe. Last weekend I had the same mindset likewise many here have voiced out {insert various whines regarding the front-lights}.

BMW,BMW M Division : The Road Ahead,post-430929,"Dec 16, 2009",Maus,"Certainly, my fellow-Dutchman AdvEvo has a very good point.,After seeing several reviews on the X6M, the conclusion always comes down to the same: ''Technically brilliant car that lacks the excitement of true M-cars''. M cars are becoming too complex and most of all: too heavy. Listen to the man who defined the future of performance motoring a long time ago; ''Simplify and increase lightness''.,Turbocharging is a way to reduce emissions and increase torque, but is also reduces something extremely important for M-cars; the emotional feeling they give you while driving them properly. Turbocharging is fine for an 120si to compete with the GTi and Megane RS, but IMO not for an M-series BMW.,M-Division cars should be the most soulful cars BMW produce, since they are historically racing cars made for the road. Why not make a lightweight high-revving 130i in the vein of the CSL...? That would blow anything it came up against (e.g. Audi S3) out of the water for pure driving excitement.,BMW's M-Division should go back to it's roots; producing lightweight and simple racing cars for the road.

BMW,91 318is I want to make it faster..,post-497625,"Jan 21, 2011",chuckhumprey,"Did you know that 318is flywheel weighs as much as a 325i flywheel(28.5 pounds). It's dual-mass seems to be a big problem since it kills first and second gear acceleration and this is also one reason why 318iS’s 0-60 is so slow. here are some options to fix this:,1) use a 325i flywheel/clutch or,2) buy an aluminum flywheel for your M42's clutch and an aluminum flywheel for using the 325i clutch.,Buying an aluminum flywheel for the M42 runs about $500-700 but is very light(requires no modification to be fitted).,M42 318is aluminum flywheels(12 pounds), and 325i aluminum fly's(8 pounds).,""The 325i flywheel requires a few other modifications to be fitted in the 318iS. Here’s what you need: 325i flywheel, 325i clutch, 325i pressure plate, 325i drive-pinion for the starter motor, and a ‘78-’83 323 throw-out bearing. Replace all these with the 318iS parts and it bolts right together. After all is said and done, your 318iS will have a LOT better acceleration in the first few gears, and deceleration will take place much quicker, which helps on the street and in the auto-x. Turner motorsport and a few other tuners also sell replacement aluminum flywheels for the 318is, but they also more expensive.""",#2,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

BMW,Help with harsh ride of my F11 please,post-504104,"Feb 26, 2011",hubris,"Hi there,,I traded my much loved 2003 E39 530i T for an F11 535i T just before Christmas. I love the extra power and the gadgets - particularly the 8-speed auto, the heads-up and the parking cameras.,However, even though I've driven close to 5000 kms, I'm having a lot of trouble liking the car. As a driving experience, the car just has not shrunk around me like the other BMWs that I've owned.,My car has the rocker with three suspension settings - Normal, Sport and Sport+. It doesn't have the active dampers, so it doesn't have the Comfort setting on the rocker. It has the stock 18"" wheels and tires. The roads here in Sydney are not great, but even so, I'm constantly being shocked and jarred by wheels crashing into cracks and small holes in the pavement. The steering feels ""disconnected"" from the front wheels somehow - I have to make many small adjustments and can't balance the car using the power as well as I could with the E39.,If I'm pushing hard in Sports+, the car feels like it has huge reserves of grip, but again I just can't get a smooth line through sweeping corners balanced on the throttle - I feel like I'm a worse driver than I am.,Can anyone recommend a combination of settings that has made this car feel good to them?,Also, is there any difference between Sports and Sports+ modes apart from the stability changes? If you have the rocker set to change the chassis and the drivetrain, what does it mean when you push the gear lever to the left?,Thanks!,Added: sorry, forgot to mention that it's the M-Sport pack, whatever that really means",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Here we do not feature huge wheel boxes or bad tuning job LEDs in the front.,Just a BMW. With its characteristic front and the L-shaped rear lights.,Brave is also the horizontal air intake in the front bumper. It looks horrible.,But maybe only because we are so used to sharp edged and sporty looking fronts, vacuum like mouths and grimm looking beasts.,But this is not what the 7 Series is about. It is a noble car. With character.,And exactly that is what it looks like. A car with character, that does not bother with periodical fashion trends of the design world and therefore is ahead of everyone else. On its own free will.,Not todays fashion created the F01.

I'm hoping the 4 series will have a diesel for the Unites States within 3-4yrs because I'm highly interested. So as of now I been working with this dealership on a 335i Xdrive 2011. Has every package, heated seats, navi, leather, but does not have M-Sport. I talked them down to $32,000 not including tax and fees and it only has 35k miles. I think that's amazing but I could be wrong. Also the BMW is in mint condition like new with one owner and perfect history.,SOOOO long story short I want to trade this in for the 4 sears diesel when it comes out. Should I get the BMW or for example, a 2014 Chevrolet Cruze or Malibu and trade in later? The 2014 Chevrolet Cruze or Malibu would have navi package only. Which one would have a better trade in value? I'm more excited for the BMW because it has all the packaged so when i go into trade they will see all the packages and value. In addition, the bmw is more fun to drive but is it worth buying over a new 2014 vehicle in the $20-$26k range?,P.S. Please let me know if you need any more information from me.,Hope you can help!

BMW,Horrible BMW 520d Ownership Experience... Please Help!,post-651269,"Jul 27, 2013",BharatAcharya,"Hey Guys,,I purchased a BMW 520d from Navnit Motors, Andheri, Mumbai, on 5th Jan 2013.,The Car is now 6 months old, and is driven around 1500 Kms.,My ownership experience has been utterly miserable and would like to share it with you all.,List of problems:,1> Within three weeks of ownership, the car developed a cracking noise from its suspension. Upon complaining, BMW acknowledged that it was a ""faulty suspension"" and hence replaced it.,2> Within 1.5 months, the car remotes started acting up! All of a sudden, both remotes would completely refuse to work. At times the car would just not unlock. Even if I used the manual key to unlock it, the engine would refuse to start. Upon being left alone for a couple of days, they would start working again. It reached a point where, every time I approached my car, I would pray in my mind, ""God, I hope it starts""! Upon complaining several times, BMW Service centre repaired it.,3> Around mid May, the brakes of the car started making some weird noise. The car was sent  to the service centre and they repaired it.,4> NOW THE NIGHTMARE. The car came back from Navnit motors service centre on around 22nd may, after brakes problem got sorted. THAT NIGHT I TOOK THE CAR FOR A SPIN WITH MY WIFE AND ANOTHER COUPLE. I WAS ON THE BANDRA WORLI SEA LINK (LONG OPEN STRETCH OF ROAD), AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BRAKES FAILED!!! A MSG CAME ON THE SCREEN SAYING “LOW OIL PRESSURE, BRAKES COMPROMISED (OR SO)”. NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE WERE AT A HIGH SPEED. THE BRAKES WERE BARELY WORKING AT 10% OF THEIR ACTUAL STRENGTH. FORTUNATELY, THE ROAD AHEAD WAS CLEAR SO I HAD AMPLE TIME TO STOP THE CAR. I DROVE MY CAR BACK HOME AT CRAWLING SPEED, WITH ALL FOUR OF US IN THE CAR THANKING OUR STARS THAT WE ARE STILL ALIVE!,The next day, I called up Navnit BMW, and got my car towed back.,They took about 3 days to respond with what had actually gone wrong with the car.,Their reply was that THERE WAS A FAULT IN THE ENGINE, AND SO THE ENTIRE ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED. THEY SAID THE ENGINE HAD TO BE IMPORTED FROM GERMANY AND SO IT WOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS, AND SO THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR TO BE USED IN THE MEANTIME.,THEY TOOK 50 DAYS (FIFTY!!!) to return back my car.,During all this time, I wrote several times to BMW India as well as BMW Germany, saying that BMW should accept their moral responsibility, and acknowledge that they have given me a FAULTY car, and hence not just replace my engine but REPLACE THE CAR INSTEAD!!!,But all my letters fell to deaf ears and the only response I got from either of them was to have patience.,50 days!!! Seriously! BMW thinks they can take people for a royal ride.,In those days, two of my EMIs have gone through! Imagine paying for a car that you cant even see around you!,In none of my letters did I ask BMW for any sort of monetary compensation. All that I wanted was something that I paid for! A reliable high quality product! I guess I was asking for too much from BMW.,After all the ordeal I faced with the car, after putting my and my families life to risk, after making me wait agonizingly for 50 days for my car to come back, after making me pay two EMIs for a car that is lying in BMW garage, all they did was leave me with no choice but to accept my car back. As a good will gesture, they offered me dvd screens for the back seats, which I really am not at all interested in and hope they take it back!!!! Aah, and free door mats. I think that’s what BMW thinks of Indian customers. I am sure if all this happened in Europe or US, BMW would have to shell out a lot as compensation. But here in India, they think the can dump their faulty products and simply get away with it!,If that’s not the case, then WHY WAS I GIVEN A CAR WITH A FAULTY SUSPENSION, FAULTY BRAKES, FAULTY ENGINE, FAULTY REMOTES???,No answers from them, just kept asking me to have patience!,I was promised, in writing and orally by BMW CRMs from western region as well as all India, that the car, after being repaired, will be thoroughly tested and will be fault free. So much so that, one of them even said, “I will resign if there is any other fault in your car!”,The car was delivered to my place two days back. At first, I didn’t know how to relate to the car, but with a heavy heart I thought lets move on.,The VERY NEXT DAY, I REALISED, THE USB PORT IS NO LONGER WORKING.,GOD DAMN IT! This is HOW DISGUSTING BMW INDIA IS!!!,I AM COMPLETELY ASHAMED OF BUYING THIS CAR, AND AM SO SO DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF FOR MAKING THIS CHOICE!!!,I feel so CHEATED!!!!,HAVE COMPLAINED TO BMW AND THEY SAID THEY ARE SENDING THEIR STAFF TO MY PLACE TOMORROW TO “REPAIR” IT.,I hope by sharing this with you all I make you aware of the “standards” of BMW INDIA (or the lack of it)!,Every detail mentioned above is true and is documented with both, BMW and myself.,If there is any way you can help me get justice, I would be eager to know that.,Car Chassis No: WBAFW75020C474795.,Dealer: BMW Navnit, Andheri, Mumbai.,People Incharge (and constantly contacted):,Mr Laukik (Service Advisor, BMW Navnit),Ms Sonali Bandivadekar(Service CRM, BMW Navnit),Mr Ravi Bhagwat (BMW NAVNIT CRM),Mr Sameer Jain (BMW Western India CRM),Mr Karan Seth (BMW India Customer Support),Mr Stephan Rausch (BMW India Director – After Sales).,My Contact Details:,Name: Bharat Acharya,Email:,Mobile: 0091 9820408217",#1,,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Male,NA,1,5,

I think the Benz S class does that. My RL doesn't do that and I nearly forgot the other day on the highway and nearly crashed. I actually hate the feature. Like say car in front of me is going slower than my set cruise, my car stays a good distant away, but when the car in front speeds up often times other cars will jump right in front of me while my car begins to accelerate and it takes the system too long to determine that a new car just jumped in front of me causing me to slam the brakes to avoid a collision.,6) I've been looking for pics of the 7 series key fob. I didn't notice that there was a regular key you can give like the valet and insert in the ignition. I'm just saying I'd rather not give anyone the whole key (key and fob), like on my RL it cost $500 to replace the key fob. Anyway I'm just happy that I don't have to take out my car key to access my car.,I was going to get a Lexus LS but after sitting down in it and looking at the cheap looking Toyota-ish instrument panel, I had to decline, since Benz and now Bmw have a bigger LCD things in the instrument panel.,If your asking why did I get a RL, well I didn't have to really pick any options, it comes with everything the car offered. Now when I get the BMW I'll have to sit down and go through all the options with the dealer, I still don't see why the rear sunblinds don't come standard with the rear side sunblinds in the BMW.","#1,535",,NA,NA,NA,2,0,

BMW,"BMW ""Never stand still"" event",post-314121,"Jul 7, 2008",cmkane04,"It seems to me that BMW is looking for a splash, Lexus is leaps and bounds ahead of BMW (and the rest of the pack) in the 'hearts and minds' of the consumer with their 'H' line of hybrid vehicles. BMW has also been a very quiet partner with General Motors, M-B & Chrysler (formerly DCX) on their Two Mode system. My assumption is that with all the talk of materials and descriptions of 'bending the rules' on classical car definitions... BMW will show one of two concepts: A F01 with lightweight panels and a two mode system or a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle in a sports car (as a follow up to the E65/66 hydrogen vehicles - but in a new segment).,The GINA vehicle was a two doors and that seemed to come out of the blue (much like the xCoupe as the precursor of the X6). Maybe a concept that will introduce a M-B CL fighter... also of talk around Munich about a 'four door coupe' and the confirmations of an 8 Series. A production ready hydrogen fueled power plant would surely surprise the public.,Also, as an extreme outside possibility, there was a recent article in the Automotive News that talked about the exit of several major carmakers design studios from the US to India, China and other 'it' markets right now. Maybe it is just the opening of a Designworks type studio in Russia.,All speculation, my money is on a two mode hybrid release in a new 7 series guise. They would beat M-B to the punch, which will need to happen if BMW expects to pull in the lead of the 'hybrid arms race' amongst the luxury car makers, remember that both companies have the same basic components and R&D information and distinction and marketing will be the only tools in selling the 'differences' to the public.,Good work to the marketing coordinators and agency... a lot of buzz and speculation!",#65,,"Detroit, MI",NA,Consultant,3,2,"2001 E38 740i,2002 E46 M3,1994 E34 525iA"

As a daily driver the car is solid in almost any weather environment; top down and wind deflector up, it is nearly as user friendly as my former Carrera 4S.  There are a number of BMW specific interfaces that I don't like: 1) having to hit buttons twice (eg turning the car off); 2) the blind spot warning system is markedly inferior to any of the Mercedes that I have had (S class, ML class, SL class); 3) voice recognition system is inferior to the Mercedes; 4) controls in console are very close to the passenger, meaning that from time to time my passenger inadvertently hits the control knob or one of the other buttons.,Having said that, no other German mark makes a better small/mid-size convertible; no one can beat the in line 6; and having the service bundled in the price is a real positive.

BMW,The BMW – A Big World of Swindle,post-902499,"Sep 12, 2018",europiir,"This is the story of how you can buy a very expensive thing and face indifference from the seller, or, to tell the truth, just a banal pursuit of profit.,What do we usually expect from very expensive things? Quality, reliability, magnificence and ... an individual approach to the buyer on the part of the seller.,However, sometimes it is the other way round – the more you pay, the worse is the attitude towards you.,Nevertheless, it happened like that in our story. The Europiir Logistics OÜ purchased a BMW 750Li in the maximum configuration for work purposes, namely the provision of services for the transportation of VIP-guests with a driver. The car was bought not in a dingy shop, but in the official representation of the BMW brand – the United Motors – in September 2016.,At the time of purchase the cost of the car was 122,700 €, it was the demonstration car, and over the time when it was owned by the United Motors AS, it drove a little bit more than 15,000 km, which, in essence, indicates that the car was practically new. The buyer carried out a test drive, he liked everything, and the parties struck a deal. As it turned out later, they would rather hadn’t done so. At least, that is how the buyer feels now.,Anyway, at first, he was pleased with the purchase as the first 2 months the car did not cause any trouble and perfectly worked for the benefit of the company.,The clouds began to gather a couple of months later, at the end of 2016. First, in the seemingly new car, the driver’s seat ventilator broke. It happens, the owner thought, nothing terrible, there is a warranty. Yes, the warranty repair was carried out. It was the customer’s first warranty request to the authorized dealer. But, as it turned out, not the last.,To understand that life is not all beer and skittles (after all, you bought a car for “just” 122 thousand euros!), a month later, around February 2017, the car on uneven roads began to make extraneous noises that were heard somewhere under the driver’s seat. The car was again taken for warranty repair, which was performed. At the same time, the warranty team also changed the turbine cooling hoses on the run (NB!) of 23,205 kilometres. And why not? The new car – the new hoses!,This was the second part, as it turned out, of the,.,Our car decided not to stop in its claims for warranty repairs. “God loves the Trinity,” the old proverb says. The BMW thought the same, and in May 2017, it was waiting for (guess what!) the third warranty repair. Now the electronic air freshener has failed. In modern luxury cars, this option, by the way, is popular as the customer himself has the right to choose which fragrance will be spread inside the salon. Okay, the failed fragrance block was repaired under the warranty, changing the thermostat along the way. Why not to please a car with a mileage of 27 312 kilometres?,The magnificent four is not only a story about 4 superheroes, but also a story about the super-BMW.,After a while the aromatization of the salon again stopped working, as well as the adjustment of the driver’s seat. The buyer was alarmed by such a “reliability” of the premium car from a renowned German manufacturer.,Further, it went from bad to worse! As it turned out, the United Motors AS, which was the official dealer and representative of the BMW company in Estonia since 2000, ceased to be its representative in June 2017, and all obligations were transferred to another enterprise – the Inchcape Motors Estonia. This fact will be important in the continuation of this story.,Shortly, pined for a while in May, but this was not yet the end of the “adventures” of the luxury car. The story was progressing, with the minor warranty repairs in October and December 2017.,The coming year of 2018 was not an exception in this endless saga. Apparently, inspired by the glitter of New Year’s trees, the instrument binnacle – of course, completely electronic – began to flicker and blink. On the next short run of 43 559 kilometres a warranty repair again was carried out. The fingers of one hand is not enough to count which one was that time.,And then thunder struck. No, not thunder, but the collapse of the engineering feast of hundreds of the BMW employees. One “fine” morning, when trying to start a car, there was an incomprehensible sound and a loud noise from under the bonnet. It was decided to immediately go to the salon to the official BMW dealer, the nearest one was the United Motors in Peetri.,However, when the buyer, tired of mishaps with the car, arrived there, he was amazed to find that the United Motors AS is no longer the official BMW dealer since June 2017, and now it is necessary to contact the new official dealer – the Inchcape Motors Estonia OÜ. Holy cats!,It might seem: the car was bought from one company, which must fulfil the obligations. By the way, the United Motors continues to trade the BMW cars to this day. But dealers are not looking for easy ways. Everyone was confused here: including the client and even the employees of the United Motors and the Inchcape themselves.,The representation office of the United Motors on Paldiski mantee was miraculously renamed to the Inchcape Motors Estonia, while the enterprise in Peetri still existed under the name of United Motors. The brain was reeling – the United Motors, Inchcape, United Motors, but one thing was clear: the car for 122,700 euros became totally useless.,As a result, representatives of the United Motors took the car to diagnose the motor and came to the conclusion that the motor got such damage that it had to be COMPLETELY changed!,Sounds nice, especially when it comes to a luxury car with a run of about 45 thousand kilometres!,No wonder, the owner was shocked by the entire situation. How come that the car in the top-end configuration, the flagship of the BMW, a premium car – and out of the blue such things? A bit comforting was the fact that the warranty on the car covered 5 years, or 200 000 km of mileage. At least, it was what the owner believed, because these conditions were specified in the price offer and in the Internet correspondence. However, as it was later found out, the contract itself contained a mistake (whether conscious or not, difficult to say). So, according to the contract, the warranty for the car is valid (NB!) 24 months only, and not 5 years, as it was originally agreed and how it is normally positioned by the BMW manufacturing company and its dealers. This issue is still under discussion, because the client understands that he himself has missed this point, but how can you ever since trust such large automobile salons as the United Motors, who have been working for many years and should value their reputation? At the time of publication of this article, the Inchcape representatives confirmed by e-mail that the warranty is valid for 5 years.,Let’s go back to the car whose heart suddenly stopped. On March 14, 2018 the client notified that the car was out of order. He was told that the engine would be replaced completely, and it would take about 2 weeks. The United Motors claims that throughout the repair process the client was kept informed of the progress of the work. Though, according to the client, he called the salon a week before the date of delivery of the car to him, where he was told that a new motor had arrived, and they needed another couple of days.,A couple of days in the understanding of an adequate person are two or three days. But it would be too easy for the United Motors: in reality the car was ready only on April 28. That is, it spent much more time in the salon. The reason behind holding the car so long was indicated as a very voluminous and complex work on motor replacement.,The United Motors replaced the engine and invited the customer to pick up the car. The client, not having received an exact answer, for what reason the car was delayed for such a long time, doubts that the replacement of the engine went smoothly.,The thing is that the warranty for the new motor is old, that is, no one wants to give a new guarantee on the fundamental node of the car, which became useless after a run of 50,000 km.,Moreover, after the client’s refusal to take the car in the current state, the United Motors and the Inchcape Motors began to send him letters with warnings that if the customer did not pick up the car, they would tow it to a paid parking lot. Why did not the customer want to pick up the car after replacing the motor? Because I was not sure that the motor was really replaced, and not assembled from different parts. Lawyers joined the case, and while they competed in the knowledge of laws and eloquence, during the 2.5 months the client had to solve work tasks using other cars and taxis because he was afraid to take his luxury car, fearing that the engine might not serve even the promised 5 years or 200 000 km, not to mention September of this year, according to the contract. As a result, the client checked the VIN-codes on the details and accepted the car. BUT!!!,What does the customer who bought a premium car want? Nothing special: that he was either returned money for an obviously defective car at a real current market price or get it replaced with the equivalent one. As otherwise he will not be able to sell the car at a market price, with such a list of warranty repairs and engine replacement. This list of warranty works was fulfilled in the period until June 15.,The article comes out in the autumn and below there will be a couple of “delicious” and ""cheap"" tricks from the Combat Vehicle of Gazumpers.,What did the representation office offer in summer and does it offer today? For this particular car BMW 750Li Xdrive in the maximum configuration, purchased for 122 700 euros, in summer they offered as much as 64 000 euros. This is 2 times less than the amount for which the customer bought it in 2016. The car is equipped with everything possible, except for remote parking key. Although initially the client was told that this option is available for this car, but on the date of the car’s transfer the dealer said that there was no such option. The client decided that he could manage without it. The car is long-bodied, elongated, there are very few such cars in Estonia. And the client was offered for it 64 000 euros only? The customer can understand that the car has lost a little in price since the end of 2016 but could not become twice cheaper! At the same time, similar, but not exactly the same models stand on a well-known auto-portal for sale at about 105 000-110 000 euros. At the end of August, after very long correspondence, calls and meetings, the Inchcape agreed to raise the cost to 67,500. Plus 3,500 euros were won through many hours of negotiations. We remind you that the initial cost of the car was 122,700.,The second offer from the United Motors was: to choose something from the range of cars that are presented on their site, but today even the most expensive car there costs about 70 000 euros and it’s not the same as the customer bought a year and a half back.,A humiliating attitude towards the client, who stayed loyal to the brand and representation office since 2012.,Also, in the summer the Inchcape maked one more offer. To replace the customer’s car with another one. Diesel, and in the package, which is cheaper than the existing version of the available model by 10 000 euros! Nevertheless, at the moment (August 30, 2013), this car on the auto24.ee portal is being sold for 117 700 euros – the company’s earnings are evident.,The client said that such a proposal did not suit him, and in the correspondence, it was stated that the Inchcape will buy the car back for 85,000 euros. Of which 12,500 is a compensation from the BMW and 5000 is the so-called sales promotion. While, the exchange vehicle would cost 112,700. The client estimated that, right, 85,000 euros will be given for the former car, he will take a replacement car for 112,700, with a smaller mileage and a year younger. When the parties came to the bank, a new surprise was awaiting: a bank was willing to give for the car only 80 000 €, and not 85 000.,The client was furious. After all, there were agreements that were once again neglected.,Imagine, the customer bought a car that cost 173 220 euros when it was absolutely new, now he is offered to change the car for a model that costs 158 000 euros if new! The difference between the two cars makes 15 000 thousand euros from the start. Is it fair?,Further, his current car upon extremely long negotiations has been valued at 80,000 euros, although he bought it for 122,700, and he is offered an alternative in the form of a car whose package is initially poorer, but for the price of 112,700. Apparently, the customer “was sold down the river” and lost 42,700 euros. Notwithstanding the fact that now he is offered a car that is cheaper than the previous one. Not a bad business? I would like to ask the BMW, where is the equivalent exchange?,All right, if only the car would stop breaking, but NO! After replacing the motor, the steering rack failed! And it has run less than 60 thousand kilometres ... HOW COME? How can such things happen? Who knows which time the car was given for warranty repair again – the rail was changed.,Adventures should always last – decided at the BMW. After the engine was replaced, there were wild vibrations along its body. And now, attention please! The official dealer Inchcape,what to do to solve this problem. The new engine was already dismantled, it was immediately put back, the vibrations remained, but the fuel consumption … increased. Immediately after the motor replacement, the consumption, instead of 12 litres, grew to 19 L! And the errors! There is no error that has not lit up on the beautiful BMW electronic panel? So, for example, recently the on-board computer wrote – the CHASSIS error! How should the buyer react? ...  Although, perhaps, you need to add a cherry on the cake: during the ride all the sensors cease to work – those of dead zones, lines, rain and others. Apparently, this BMW has the option “go back to the roots”. The car just collapses, and the representation cannot make an equivalent exchange for the same car. There seems to be no end to the countless warranty repairs.,To our bitter disappointment, it is impossible to use the unreliable vehicle and perform the work for which the car was bought, while the client has to look for alternatives for carrying out his work activities, spend money on lawyers, taxis for trips to the car salons. Nobody will compensate for the time, nerves and forces spent, and, most importantly, you cannot return the belief that by paying huge money, you will not be humiliated, being considered just another client in a line of customers, who suddenly needed something. It’s a pity that such large salons as the United Motors AS and the Inchcape Motors Estonia OÜ regard their loyal customers, who regularly buy their cars, as if we every day come to a posh shop and buy only a loaf of bread for 1 euro.,Buying a product of premium quality for big money, one certainly does not expect lies, omissions or disgusting attitude. To our great disillusionment, the BMW appears to be the Big World of Swindle.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,1,

BMW,BMW 6-Series GT,post-914657,"Dec 7, 2018",marc1adrien,"Well, I thought I'd weigh in on all the speculation with a real world experience. I leased one.,I'm 6'3, 48, avid cyclist. Coming from an e350 wagon (or estate) and am in the USA. I grew up in Canada and England, and I didn't want an SUV. My American wife has one, and it's nice enough, but it's not so much something you drive as it is a nice place to spend time.,Criteria for new car: AWD, nice, an actual ""car"" that can be ""driven"" (I used to have miatas), a little different, the latest tech for connectivity and distance cruise control. Most companies don't bring wagons to the USA anymore. I could get another MB wagon (e450), a small Audi (only the A4 all road) or look at fastbacks. I have no desire to drive a sedan, and a hatch to be able to put in a bike is a great idea.,Tried an A7 (previous body). Nice, but WAY too small -- my head was brushing the a-pillar where it meets the roof as the car is very ""pinched"" at the roof. Not interested as a Volvo since my wife has one. S5 Sportback was appealing, but very expensive on lease. And the e450 was basically custom-order only, and expensive.,I test drove a 640GT and found it intriguing. Plenty quick, quiet, and roomy, with very nice tech. Looks-wise it reminds me of the old Rover v8s and Alfa GTVs, both of which I loved when I was...about 10. Set up right, it drives very nicely.,And here's the real thing -- in the USA, they are deeply discounted and lease well. I won't go into details, but as a corporate lease on a car that lists close to $80k, the e450 Wagon would have run close to $1,500 a month for what I wanted. Amazingly, the s5 was MORE at about $1,600, despite being a substantially cheaper car (about $65,000). I ended up in a 640gt that listed at 79,900 for under $1,000 / month.,The reason is that BMW backs them, residuals are decent, dealers have a few allocated, and they don't sell well. So they end up being deeply discounted (as in 10-15%), but still have the residual.,In 3 months, it's grown on me a lot. I've seen exactly zero others, my daughter can sit comfortably behind me, and, amazingly, it gets quite good milage on the highway for such a large and capable car. People ask me about it all the time. It's clever, between the air curtain and closing grille, and the eco plus works well (I programmed it to have the tightest steering). Drives like it's a solid piece of metal. I like the way it looks 80% of the time, especially the front 3/4 view, and especially viewed from above. It's an M, dark grey with the Dakota piped leather.",#16,,NA,NA,NA,3,44,
BMW,BMW 750Li NEW bought in Estonia and it is SHAME!,post-923211,"Feb 28, 2019",europiir2019,"The BMW – A Big World of Swindle,Or how to buy a premium car for 122 thousand euros and be disappointed in people,This is the story of how you can buy a very expensive thing and face indifference from the seller, or, to tell the truth, just a banal pursuit of profit.,What do we usually expect from very expensive things? Quality, reliability, magnificence and ... an individual approach to the buyer on the part of the seller.,However, sometimes it is the other way round – the more you pay, the worse is the attitude towards you.,Nevertheless, it happened like that in our story. The Europiir Logistics OÜ purchased a BMW 750Li in the maximum configuration for work purposes, namely the provision of services for the transportation of VIP-guests with a driver. The car was bought not in a dingy shop, but in the official representation of the BMW brand – the United Motors – in September 2016.,At the time of purchase the cost of the car was 122,700 €, it was the demonstration car, and over the time when it was owned by the United Motors AS, it drove a little bit more than 15,000 km, which, in essence, indicates that the car was practically new. The buyer carried out a test drive, he liked everything, and the parties struck a deal. As it turned out later, they would rather hadn’t done so. At least, that is how the buyer feels now.,Anyway, at first, he was pleased with the purchase as the first 2 months the car did not cause any trouble and perfectly worked for the benefit of the company.,The clouds began to gather a couple of months later, at the end of 2016. First, in the seemingly new car, the driver’s seat ventilator broke. It happens, the owner thought, nothing terrible, there is a warranty. Yes, the warranty repair was carried out. It was the customer’s first warranty request to the authorized dealer. But, as it turned out, not the last.,To understand that life is not all beer and skittles (after all, you bought a car for “just” 122 thousand euros!), a month later, around February 2017, the car on uneven roads began to make extraneous noises that were heard somewhere under the driver’s seat. The car was again taken for warranty repair, which was performed. At the same time, the warranty team also changed the turbine cooling hoses on the run (NB!) of 23,205 kilometres. And why not? The new car – the new hoses!,This was the second part, as it turned out, of the Ballet de la Merlaison.,Our car decided not to stop in its claims for warranty repairs. “God loves the Trinity,” the old proverb says. The BMW thought the same, and in May 2017, it was waiting for (guess what!) the third warranty repair. Now the electronic air freshener has failed. In modern luxury cars, this option, by the way, is popular as the customer himself has the right to choose which fragrance will be spread inside the salon. Okay, the failed fragrance block was repaired under the warranty, changing the thermostat along the way. Why not to please a car with a mileage of 27 312 kilometres?,The magnificent four is not only a story about 4 superheroes, but also a story about the super-BMW.,After a while the aromatization of the salon again stopped working, as well as the adjustment of the driver’s seat. The buyer was alarmed by such a “reliability” of the premium car from a renowned German manufacturer.,Further, it went from bad to worse! As it turned out, the United Motors AS, which was the official dealer and representative of the BMW company in Estonia since 2000, ceased to be its representative in June 2017, and all obligations were transferred to another enterprise – the Inchcape Motors Estonia. This fact will be important in the continuation of this story.,Shortly, pined for a while in May, but this was not yet the end of the “adventures” of the luxury car. The story was progressing, with the minor warranty repairs in October and December 2017.,The coming year of 2018 was not an exception in this endless saga. Apparently, inspired by the glitter of New Year’s trees, the instrument binnacle – of course, completely electronic – began to flicker and blink. On the next short run of 43 559 kilometres a warranty repair again was carried out. The fingers of one hand is not enough to count which one was that time.,And then thunder struck. No, not thunder, but the collapse of the engineering feast of hundreds of the BMW employees. One “fine” morning, when trying to start a car, there was an incomprehensible sound and a loud noise from under the bonnet. It was decided to immediately go to the salon to the official BMW dealer, the nearest one was the United Motors in Peetri.,However, when the buyer, tired of mishaps with the car, arrived there, he was amazed to find that the United Motors AS is no longer the official BMW dealer since June 2017, and now it is necessary to contact the new official dealer – the Inchcape Motors Estonia OÜ. Holy cats!,It might seem: the car was bought from one company, which must fulfil the obligations. By the way, the United Motors continues to trade the BMW cars to this day. But dealers are not looking for easy ways. Everyone was confused here: including the client and even the employees of the United Motors and the Inchcape themselves.,The representation office of the United Motors on Paldiski mantee was miraculously renamed to the Inchcape Motors Estonia, while the enterprise in Peetri still existed under the name of United Motors. The brain was reeling – the United Motors, Inchcape, United Motors, but one thing was clear: the car for 122,700 euros became totally useless.,As a result, representatives of the United Motors took the car to diagnose the motor and came to the conclusion that the motor got such damage that it had to be COMPLETELY changed!,Sounds nice, especially when it comes to a luxury car with a run of about 45 thousand kilometres!,No wonder, the owner was shocked by the entire situation. How come that the car in the top-end configuration, the flagship of the BMW, a premium car – and out of the blue such things? A bit comforting was the fact that the warranty on the car covered 5 years, or 200 000 km of mileage. At least, it was what the owner believed, because these conditions were specified in the price offer and in the Internet correspondence. However, as it was later found out, the contract itself contained a mistake (whether conscious or not, difficult to say). So, according to the contract, the warranty for the car is valid (NB!) 24 months only, and not 5 years, as it was originally agreed and how it is normally positioned by the BMW manufacturing company and its dealers. This issue is still under discussion, because the client understands that he himself has missed this point, but how can you ever since trust such large automobile salons as the United Motors, who have been working for many years and should value their reputation? At the time of publication of this article, the Inchcape representatives confirmed by e-mail that the warranty is valid for 5 years.,Let’s go back to the car whose heart suddenly stopped. On March 14, 2018 the client notified that the car was out of order. He was told that the engine would be replaced completely, and it would take about 2 weeks. The United Motors claims that throughout the repair process the client was kept informed of the progress of the work. Though, according to the client, he called the salon a week before the date of delivery of the car to him, where he was told that a new motor had arrived, and they needed another couple of days.,A couple of days in the understanding of an adequate person are two or three days. But it would be too easy for the United Motors: in reality the car was ready only on April 28. That is, it spent much more time in the salon. The reason behind holding the car so long was indicated as a very voluminous and complex work on motor replacement.,The United Motors replaced the engine and invited the customer to pick up the car. The client, not having received an exact answer, for what reason the car was delayed for such a long time, doubts that the replacement of the engine went smoothly.,The thing is that the warranty for the new motor is old, that is, no one wants to give a new guarantee on the fundamental node of the car, which became useless after a run of 50,000 km.,Moreover, after the client’s refusal to take the car in the current state, the United Motors and the Inchcape Motors began to send him letters with warnings that if the customer did not pick up the car, they would tow it to a paid parking lot. Why did not the customer want to pick up the car after replacing the motor? Because I was not sure that the motor was really replaced, and not assembled from different parts. Lawyers joined the case, and while they competed in the knowledge of laws and eloquence, during the 2.5 months the client had to solve work tasks using other cars and taxis because he was afraid to take his luxury car, fearing that the engine might not serve even the promised 5 years or 200 000 km, not to mention September of this year, according to the contract. As a result, the client checked the VIN-codes on the details and accepted the car. BUT!!!,What does the customer who bought a premium car want? Nothing special: that he was either returned money for an obviously defective car at a real current market price or get it replaced with the equivalent one. As otherwise he will not be able to sell the car at a market price, with such a list of warranty repairs and engine replacement. This list of warranty works was fulfilled in the period until June 15.,The article comes out in the autumn and below there will be a couple of “delicious” and ""cheap"" tricks from the Combat Vehicle of Gazumpers.,What did the representation office offer in summer and does it offer today? For this particular car BMW 750Li Xdrive in the maximum configuration, purchased for 122 700 euros, in summer they offered as much as 64 000 euros. This is 2 times less than the amount for which the customer bought it in 2016. The car is equipped with everything possible, except for remote parking key. Although initially the client was told that this option is available for this car, but on the date of the car’s transfer the dealer said that there was no such option. The client decided that he could manage without it. The car is long-bodied, elongated, there are very few such cars in Estonia. And the client was offered for it 64 000 euros only? The customer can understand that the car has lost a little in price since the end of 2016 but could not become twice cheaper! At the same time, similar, but not exactly the same models stand on a well-known auto-portal for sale at about 105 000-110 000 euros. At the end of August, after very long correspondence, calls and meetings, the Inchcape agreed to raise the cost to 67,500. Plus 3,500 euros were won through many hours of negotiations. We remind you that the initial cost of the car was 122,700.,The second offer from the United Motors was: to choose something from the range of cars that are presented on their site, but today even the most expensive car there costs about 70 000 euros and it’s not the same as the customer bought a year and a half back.,A humiliating attitude towards the client, who stayed loyal to the brand and representation office since 2012.,Also, in the summer the Inchcape maked one more offer.

It took me about 5 min to do it,Here is the back end with simple rear lights and little wider tires.,Some renders here on the forum are pretty accurate, but I would like to highlight the front lights.,They are more angulated than the ones on the 7 series. More like M4 iconic lights.,That will give the 5 series more sporty and dynamic look. If I find the time I will do some highly precise drawings of the car without disguise. The car has almost perfect proportions for a big sedan, I like it a lot!,Cheers!","#1,205",,Europe,Male,NA,5,101,

It has been a while I notice on my BMW E87 2006 that from idle engine when press the Clutch to put in 1st gear usually I hear a strange sound from below the car. It sounds like transmition or differential gears even without put in any gear yet or sometimes like exhaust gasses and this is in different places at length of the vehicle. Though this is a one-time sound but happens almost half of the idle times on the road. I also confirmed the same issue exists on my wifes car Toyota Auris 2010. What is this?

More the tires is stickier and more camber you should have, as Mclaren done on the press P1 coming back in Anglesey.,See MP4-12C Sport auto supertest where the Macca was with over 2 degrees of front camber and totally out of Standard wheel alignment.,The independent test you refer have been driven by Michelin that provided Porsche and tyres.,This is really a ridiculous statement.

I consider too much for an old car. Anyone would know if the prices are dropping down as car ages? I would be interested if supply price in Austria or Germany is somewhere cheaper? By the other hand good companies offer optimisation (chip tunning) for approx 500€. i know original power kit has additional components, but nevertheless i consider that changing brakes would not be necessary in my case. Intercooler replacement seems legit to me. Old one could be sold as well. Stickers - trash. Since this forum seems like more American it will be hard to find some Austrian members?

Quality of interior I believe is super somehow S-Class has always been ahead and it's true in a few areas even at this point esp. the seat bases in the 7 are of bad plastic , the lower half of the B-Pillars again bad plastic, but keeping these few areas aside I find the cabin a lot better than S. Design being subjective I love the simplicity it has,2. I do not have the Executive Drive Pro but the car drives well over bad roads etc. one area where the 7 doesn't feel good are those plastic speed breakers a few office compounds use to slow you down it sort of goes hard over those,3. Gesture controls are ok, I've never had an issue with them infact was getting used to changing songs / Radio stations with them but due to my niece I've fully disabled them as she keeps playing with it.,4. Remote Park : a lovely feature and I would never again buy a car without it but two things need an improvement firstly the key is very laggy I wish BMW would allow the operation from the phone or allow a better interface and secondly I wish it was more seamless, I mean if I wish to get it into garage I must first stop the car and stop the engine and then,Get out and then start the engine with the key and then do it I wish it was able to do it without me having to stop the engine etc.,5. I would say avoid the Executive Lounge as by taking that option I have a very basic passenger seat as it doesn't get a lot of feature due to the Lounge but I do love the seats in general with the Massage / Ventilation.,6. My side window sun shades rattle a lot and I need to show that,7. THe auto park is a joy to use as you no more have to move the car from R/D and life could not have been better,Hope the above help, if there is any more questions do ask me will try answer all in my capacity,Have a nice day,","#2,658",post: 823612,400001,Female,NA,4,21,

Despite being not-quite production ready, on this evidence, Bentley has turned the GT from a good car into a genuinely great one. This is possibly the best grand tourer in the world.,It is quite a car, is the new Bentley Continental GT. For approximately £156,000 you could even call it a bargain. That’s the same money that Aston Martin asks for a V8 DB11 – which is easily the best DB11, but which is still not especially close to being as good as the new Conti GT is. Then there’s the Ferrari GTC Lusso, which is a fine machine, but can’t match the Bentley for all round value, appeal or pure ability. For sure, this is the best GT car in the world right now.,The all-new Conti GT shares much of its DNA with the Panamera.

Because 1991 was the last year I remember seen lot's of sparks coming out of the underbody due to it being very low. In 92 and 93, the sparks were just rare as today. I think FIA introduced something already for 92. Plus, how does the ground clearance of 91 compare with that of today?,And it's not a myth that 2006/2007/2008 cars had record downforce. Williams car in 81 had peak 2900kgs of downforce at 320kmh, around the same as a 2004 car. The 1993/1994 had even less, in the neighbourhood of 2600kgs for the same speed.,In 2008, the cars had between 3200-3600kgs at 320kmh, so the highest downforce ever in F1.,Where did you took those numbers you posted from? Peter Wright's book? You see that Lotus 79 had even less downforce than the cars in 81 which had more developed ground effect?!,What is the source for cars having bigger diffuser after 87 and the 0,5s gain with 1mm lower ride height?,Champ Car/Indy NEVER had more downforce than F1, not even using more ground effect.

Audi,Audi Drivers and Engineers Explain the Importance of Tyres,post-570984,"Mar 23, 2012",michelinuk,"All car drivers are aware that they are black, round and keep their expensive alloy wheels off the ground but not many appreciate the benefits of choosing the right tyres for their car and style of driving.,Michelin has interviewed some of the team’s drivers and race engineers to find out why they choose to fit Michelin tyres and why they feel fitting the correct tyres is important from a racing and road car point of view. And no, it’s not because the tyres are supplied free of charge as race teams pay like anyone else.,Unlike Formula 1, endurance racing tyres are closely linked, in terms of size and performance characteristics, to those used on high performance road cars. Endurance racing calls for tyres that will last as long as possible while offering high levels of grip in various conditions from their first lap to their last. As a result, in last year’s Le Mans 24 hour race, the No.2 Audi R18 TDI managed to race for 750kms on one set of tyres, and at speeds of up to 330km/h with three Peugeots in hot pursuit.,In 2012 Audi will field two R18 e-tron quattro’s and two R18 ultra prototypes at Le Mans – all shod with Michelin tyres. The two hybrid cars will be driven by last year’s Le Mans winning trio of Marcel Fässler, André Lotterer, and Benoît Tréluyer with Dindo Capello, Tom Kristensen, and Allan McNish in the other car. The R18 Ultra will see Loïc Duval joined by Timo Bernhard and Romain Dumas with the other R18 Ultra driven by Marco Bonanomi, Oliver Jarvis and Mike Rockenfeller.,In the video, drivers Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen, and race engineer Howden Haynes share their views and experiences of tyres and talk about how innovation in motorsport benefits drivers with better cars and tyres.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Usually their maps are excellent and switchable with the SPS device.,From an STronic point of view - the new 7 Speed derivative as fitted in the S4 and (presumably) forthcoming RS5 can safely handle quoted manufacturer torque limits of 550nm - so I'd venture that B&B,s remaps even at stage 3 are safe.,The 6 speed DSG box that has seen duty so far in transverse applications, although only rated to 350nm, safely handles 400nm plus ... so there are over engineered safety tolerances built in. I wouldn't be surprised to see the new longitudinal 7 speed model handle 600nm with ease.,Anyhow - great to join your forum and will keep an eye on the discussions in this thread with interest.,Hopefully forge come out with a decent intake system for the S4 as well - always good for 10kw extra or thereabouts...,Cheers,Wusman",#10,,NA,NA,NA,7,1,

The Audi quite clearly has superior build quality - especially the interior which is in a different league to the BMW. In my opinion it also has much better styling.

Audi,Why Audi Is Going to Beat Mercedes [Esquire],post-360228,"Jan 18, 2009",MJB5654,"I have a 2009 A4, and to tell you the truth it is way better than the c350 which i almost bought. I went to viti mercedes, which is the best mercedes dealer in new england, and took the car out for a test drive and had the car for a few days, thanks viti, but it felt cheap. There was plastic and places where there shouldn't be for a 45,000 to 50,000 dollar car. Then i went to Inskip Audi to check out the a5 but saw a a4. It was the 2.0T prestige with everything in it and in black. It just felt so amazing. Everything was so well built and i took it on a test drive and the thing settles in at 100 mph. The interior was vastly different, the audi was roomier and it had a cockpit feel with everything position to the driver. I mean, on the mercedes leather isn't even standard. I go to a boarding school, for which i am a day student, and almost everyone has a Mercedes c300 4matic or c350, or a bmw 3-series. When i showed up to school in my brand new audi everyone came over there and was blown away, i ever heard wows, and to be quite honest we are the most discrimination group so when they saw wow its sorta a big deal. So when you say that the c-class has better quality and nicer interior, i have to ask, do you own one. I have had my audi for 3 months now with no problems at all and after years of growing up with mercedes, and such, i have to stay i will always own a audi. In november, i went to the auto show in boston and i was talking to many sales representative from almost every european company, but what struck me was how when i was talking to a mercedes-benz rep, i told that person that I could never own the current c-class because of how cheap i felt it. The rep automatically asked me what car i own and i told her a 2009 audi a4. Let me say, she understood. She said that the new a4 was a class leader and that her significant other actually bought the a4. Now this is not audi fan boy propaganda cause i honestly believe in the large luxury segment that Mercedes-Benz S-class has no compition, at-least till the new a8. The mercedes is wonderful and is used as the executive car at my fathers company so i spend much time being driven in them and now with my license i drive them sometimes. But to say that the a4 doesn't have the quality of a lowly c-class is ridiculous. Now being a member of the new york yacht club and some other yacht clubs i have to say the car of choice has become a audi. So your whole speech about the prestige of mercedes and bmw is a bunch of b.s. What most of the member's believe is that everyone with new money goes right to the mercedes dealership and people with bmw's are arrogant, and also new money, not to say that people with old money don't have either car. I mean most people with new money think a Phantom and a bentley continental serious is great, they are ostentatious and ghastly, a footballers car in every aspect, so there outlook on things is so, so. I mean m neighbor has a Bentley Continental Gt Speed, and it is nothing compared to my grandmothers Arnage, not even in the same league. So, i guess depending on your market.....It is all relative. Now back to audi, I honestly can say that the new a4 is the best vehicle in its class and considering my peers all have cars from the class and our parents have the top class of cars, i can tell you and so can they, the new a4, has no compition in its class.

I have been thinking of buying the new A4, but the ""low"" ground clearance would be a problem when going to my winter cottage and when we get a lot of snow. In Norway`s capital, Oslo we have now 100 cm with snow, this creates problems when parking and driving around in a regular A4 before the snow is removed.,Yes, the Q5 will also do the job but we have a lot of taxes on cars in Norway, this relates to power, weight and CO2 emissions. The A4 allroad will be around 10 000 dollar cheaper with the 2.0 TFSI engine - then you get a car that also performes better onroad, but is useful when we have a lot of snow. But it disapoints me that it will not come with air-suspension. A well equipped A4 Allroad 2.0 TFSi will cost 100 000+ USD here in Norway.,The A6 allroad is one of the most popular cars in Norway due to the higher road clearance and a much more nicer emisson reputation and prices than the SUVs.

My experience so far is limited to my last car, another Audi that had an Oettinger tune done to a 3 ltr Tdi Quattro. This was a vast improvement. My research has led me to two companies at this point. Either ABT or APR. These are two different approaches to a similar end result. ABT seems to be a ""simpler"" approach if I can use that generalization. It comes with a two year warranty on the drivetrain but is more expensive. I don't mind the expense if I consider it warrants it. The APR seems to be logical as well, giving the supercharger a tweek for good measure. This system does throw up flags however and does not give any form of warranty. The guys who service my car install APR products. As a by the by Oettinger doesn't list the 3ltr Petrol engine in their products. I know there are many other tunes out there but one has to eventually distill things down. My question. Or questions. Has anybody had both at one time or another? Has anybody had problems on this drivetrain/motor with either?

This means Audi’s next large sedan and hatch will switch from front/all-wheel drive and become standard with rear-wheel drive.

I’ve been researching this and have found conflicting results!,Originally I assumed that as these engines push out 650nm-700nm of torque then it was likely ZF would supply the “70” variant as you stated.,However, when I used an Audi parts finder it states the gearbox fitted to the S8 is Part Number:0BK-300-037-X-003 (and similar variants for RS6/7 e.g. 0BK-300-041-M-003, 0BK-300-040-G-002, 0BK-300-040-G-003, 0BK-300-041-F-002 etc) which when cross referenced to the ZF link is the “55” variant (8HP55 AHIS to be precise).,This was rather confusing as ZF rate this as 550nm maximum torque, until I found another link to an Audi training manual that stated the “55” transmission was good for 700nm of maximum torque!,I’m still confused though....the S8 Plus and RS6/7 performance can push out 750nm of torque on overboost but still share the same ZF “55” per the parts finder...,Can anyone help? I’m researching the safe tolerances of the transmission before exploring any tuning enhancements?!",#5,post: 752086,NA,NA,NA,1,1,

Audi,Audi A4 (B9) Spy Pics & Info,post-749670,"Jun 6, 2015",Zendo911,"Let's clear some points out of the way:,1) It's really difficult to improve on the timeless design of the B8, in the same way it was difficult to improve on the previous generation R8 .. Very few car manufacturers can improve on their masterclass designs comes the next generation .. Just look at the new Jag XF !!!,2) With that in mind, they were still obliged to adhere to their new design language, the sharper and more angular corners, the same way all luxury car manufacturers do. The thing is, design languages give luxury cars the time and generation context they need, this car needs to look like a modern Audi, and modern Audi's have sharper and more angular lines, so is this one.,3) Now, if I were a designer who, for obvious reasons, wanted to play it safe after coming from a very successful car, and I'm also supposed to follow a certain design language, this would be mostly the best I can come up with, which is/won't be bad .. it WILL satisfy a lot of tastes.,4)  I can tell that a lot of details are still hidden, and typically one would expect these details to compliment the final design of the car. Audi in specific has a good history in refreshing a car's look via a facelift that tackles only fine details, I don't expect them to let us down in that department.,Overall, I think we will be in for a good overall car design comes the official reveal.",#584,,Dubai,Male,NA,2,4,

Audi,first new experience with audi e-tron 2019,post-938594,"Jul 8, 2019",mohssine,"Okay, the all-electric Audi.,Difficult to say however, would it say that it is not? No vehicle that screams radically about its electrical certifications. A remarkable reverse truth is told. A vehicle intended to unequivocally not express shocks by a piece of the imagination. This is of course the ultimate fate. To persuade a standard collection of people to make the switch, you can't be afraid that they are radical in structure.,You can indicate that the e-tron has been to a larger number of centres than a general practitioner. The size (5-place exactly, bigger than a Q5, smaller than a Q7), the shape (conventional SUV, with an ambiguously changed grille), the lodge (a modestly intriguing new gear lever, but nothing new). It has been cautious, hesitantly considered to speak as an extensive area of the EV- tempting as was reasonably to be expected.,Indeed, € 80,000 to spend.,Welcome, but there are currently very many vehicles in that part, from the specified Velars to the new BMW X5 and Merc GLE, in addition to exceptions, for example, the Maserati Levante. Indeed, even the best spec domains fall into this section. So it's a considerable huge swimming pool where the e-tron dives in awkwardly.,Is it Substantial?,Just 10 kg less than 2.5 tons. That's because it's not mounted on a custom-made electric stage, but the equivalent base as the Q7, adapted to suit. Audi, however, has gotten the best from its German opponents - the Merc EQC is less than a few months away and BMW iX3 won't be around for another year. However, you can now buy an e-tron in Belgium, at a cost starting at € 84,100, which the current government will willingly pay another € 3.500 discount. In fact, you can't have one at the moment, because Audi will satisfy the 1,000+ development orders during the first few months.,Would the customers like E-tron?,In case they are currently driving an advanced Audi without a doubt. To a large extent it is indistinguishable from each other. The same design with three screens and many menus, the same control box, care, quality. There is almost no radical in the list of alternatives, except for one thing:,Bron; De Nieuwe Elektrische Auto 2019 - Audi e-tron Beoordeling - De nieuwste auto's",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Audi,The new Audi TT,post-916514,"Dec 29, 2018",foad,"When it comes to facelifts it’s fair to say the 2018 Audi TT hasn’t exactly been subjected to the kind of major surgery you’d find lining the walls of a Hollywood dentist’s waiting room.,But then again all three versions of this car have aged very well indeed – first generation models arguably look just as fresh 20 years on.,There’s also very little need for Ingolstadt to be constantly fettling its small coupe. With the VW Scirocco phased out the TT has few natural rivals, at least not with a practicality-enhancing rear bench - although two seat rivals are more plentiful.,Within those strict parameters the Audi only really needs to worry about the BMW 2 Series and Toyota GT86/Subaru BRZ, plus the larger Ford Mustang.,A bit of a nip and tuck here and there - a new grille and bumper design, two new paint colours and a different wheel designs to keep 2014’s car looking fresh.,Sportier models (S Line and TTS) get additional air intakes and vents front and rear for additional purpose, although we’re not sure they do anything practical as they’re blanked off.,You do get more standard kit than before – Audi’s Drive Select system, light and rain sensors, multifunction steering wheel, heated door mirrors and the central rev counter layout for the Virtual Cockpit from the TTRS. And light-up USB ports, would you believe.,Sort of – but here’s where it gets a bit confusing. Like the VW Golf R the 2.0-litre TTS now features a gasoline particulate filter to reduce its carbon footprint, which subtlety changes the noise it makes and more importantly means a reduced power output of 302bhp.,Usefully though you get 15lbs-ft of torque and a new seven-speed S tronic automatic gearbox as standard (with no manual option any more) so the 0-62mph time is one tenth quicker, at 4.5 seconds.,You won’t notice the drop in power or the extra torque, because in reality the TTS still rips along at a remarkable pace, in the utterly unflustered way we’re come to expect in fast Audis.,Of course, but that’s no bad thing, if that’s what you want. Our test route for this updated model was the mildly terrifying Isle of Man mountain road - the one that gets used for the TT road race and doesn’t have a speed limit, you know the one.,i have a blog that explain about audi tt,this so good,Given that you don’t really have any run-off (unless you count a drystone wall or hundred meter drop as run-off) we were quite grateful to be in a forgiving but pacey all-wheel drive coupe.,Confidence-inspiring grip from the standard issue Quattro all-wheel drive makes this a great point-to-point car, with two-dimensional handling balanced neatly with the sensation that it’s got stacks of ability held in reserve.,It remains an easy, but not rewarding, car to drive very quickly indeed, particularly now you get Audi magnetic ride – a more advanced type of adaptive damping system - as standard.,The old car always felt very firm and while the 2018 TT isn’t exactly a limo it’s much better at absorbing bumps without compromising its tidy body control and sharp turn-in.,As a result we thoroughly enjoyed driving the TT on its namesake route on the Isle of Man - although in reality you’d have fun piloting the Chuckle Brothers’s pedal-powered car up there.",#406,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Hyundai / Genesis,Hyundai: Sonata has better paint quality than MB CLS,post-464931,"Jun 2, 2010",hermanski22,"first of all, the sonata is obviously not a direct competitor to mercedes as hyundai is now the company that is making one of the biggest showups in auto history. You have to consder the fact hyundais main competition is the affordable companies such as toyota, honda, nissan, chevrolet(just their cars not trucks or suvs), ford, etc. By comparing itself to the mercedes paint class, it is not degrading mercedes paint class and trying to compete with luxury cars. It is generally to make themselves stand out compared to their competitors by basically saying it has something that can actually compete with one of the world's most astounding car companies, while the others honestly cant. Obviously cars from Mercedes and BMW are gonna be better in everything than any Hyundai, Toyota, or Honda but it is a key to competition. By comparing yourself to the best even in one way it will obviously boost the effect the car will have.,Take the NBA for instance. Kevin Durant is obviously a really good player winning rookie of the year and contending for MVP and everything but he is not considered a ""PRO"" such as Dwayne Wade or Kobe Bryant. But because he can consistently score better than them, he is given good credit and is just as a major influence on the NBA as them. And that is exactly what Hyundai did. They took one thing and kinda ran with it. Yes it is not the most important thing in the world, it is still something it can compare with them.,second. Mozarts and Schuberts Sonatas were revolutionary things for these two musicians. as the sonatas they are most famously known for were written more early in their careers. It is obviously relevant because the Sonata is the most radical thing for hyundai and currently the auto industry.,third. hyundai is not the 'cheap ass cars'. these days they are becoming reliable vehicles as almost all of their vehicles have the 5 star safety guarantees and awards and junk. They are basically the new trend of cars as more customers are looking for hyundai and their rising standards of their cars. they are probably the best cars for their price... even consider the upcoming hyundai equus. this is a car that when itt was compared in korea by international proffesionals from different countries many have found it to better in value and quality than SOME BMW or Mercedes. and one of the main factors is the label.,MERCEDES is basically comparable to  ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH while Hyundai is basically like GAP or Old Navy or even American Eagle. While A&F is very stylish, it is completely overpriced. A&F no matter how good you think it looks and how popular it is, they are made of very cheap materials but are considered good mainly because it is a popular trend and people, always wanting to conform to society, will buy it so they are smart and began to increase their prices because in the beginning, A&F were just like LEVIS where it started small but the brand label grew.,So dont think for a minute that Hyundai is not a good auto maker. They are probably the best in its class. Their cars are superior in many ways compared to its competition.,Compare the Elantra; Corolla; Cobalt; Focus... the civic is still probably the strongest leader of the compact cars however from Honda the Fit would now be a better choice.,Compare the Sonata; Camry; Accord; Fusiion; Malibu... in most cases the Sonata easily dominates its competitors.,AND you must also consider the massive growth that Hyundai is now having where some places have increased Hyundai sales in Triple Digits. Hyundai will become the new affordable standard and its the other companies jobs to make sure to stay ahead.,There are mainly ignorant people in the first page i read sorry about that statement.",#38,,NA,NA,NA,2,0,

The other day, I had to drive up a few floors to park my car (3F) at a closeby department store.   There were many customers thus many cars trying to park there.  While going up, I came to a stop between 2F and 3F because cars were waiting in line.  When it came for me to move up I took my foot off the brake and before getting to press the accelerator my car started slipping back.,If it's automatic, even if I take off my foot from the brake, shouldn't it at least NOT slip backwards?

I hope it will also be available in more muted colours, locally.,As for the roof rails, I'd love to know if flat crossbars in the same silver are available, as some of the square tubing type crossbars I've seen really detract from the smooth appearance, never mind that it ruins the aerodynamics.,My final reservation: I realise this to be a true softroader, but would really have appreciated more than 1.5cm's extra ground clearance to cope with the `middelmannetjies' on our dirt roads. At least double that would have made more sense.,Lest I seem to be detracting from the next car I'm buying, it's more a case of knowing its abilities and living accordingly.

The rate of defect is so high that Volkswagen has determined the defective cars are too expensive to fix, rather they have decided to dump these cars with defective suspensions on unsuspecting customers who make the mistake of walking into a Volkswagen Dealership.,In fact, our understanding is that these defective cars have a mark down incentive to the dealers, encouraging dealers to dump them on unaware customers. Volkswagen hopes the duped customers won't notice the defect, or if they do then they will refuse to fix the defective cars. The trade-off for Volkswagen of pissing off a few customers and/or fighting a few lawsuits is much less then the cost of having to fix all their defective cars.,They can do this because the suspension defect is not a safety Hazard, and as a result the government will not get involved.,I, the author of this post, am a victim.

Volkswagen,Passat B6 2.0TDI Trans Oil Change+Other questions.,post-1002550,"Nov 25, 2020",sebba2,"Hi guys.,So I bought my Passat B6 two weeks ago and ive spent loads of time on highly needed cleaning and tidying it up and did an oil and filter service before a longer trip last weekend.,The Passat has got 190.000KMs on it at the moment and I havent checked or replaced the gearbox oil on it yet. Dunno what the service intervals on these gearboxes are, but im quite sure the DSG gearboxes are 60.000kms and ive believe the manual gearbox oil that comes from the factory isnt really to be serviced ever, at least as far as I can see in the service documentation on the veichle, its never been done. (All services until i bought it were done at the local VW workshop by the previous owner. Since the car is 13 years old, I do not see the point in spending a ton of money to keep servicing it at the unserious local VW workshop so im doing it myself),Technincal info:,2.0TDI 140HP 2007 Wagon, PD/engine code is BKP.,I would love some feedback from you guys... :,1: Exactly how much gear oil do I need to do the oil change? I know there is a filler plug that the oil is supposed to be filled up to, but I cant find out how much I actually need.,2: Does the gearbox have a filter? I know the DSGs do have filters but im 98% sure the manual one doesnt. (yes im new to old VW`s.,3: Can someone confirm that this engine has the dual-mass flywheel? Im also 98% sure that it does have one.. Lol.,4: The clutch feels fine, but when the engine is really cold/right after cold starting it in -5C, the clutch makes a slight (not loud) ""grindy"" noise when I drop the clutch half the way down. When its all the way in or out, there is no noise. After idling/heating up a little there is no noise either. Its not loud at all, it just worried me a little. Should I be worried? Ive worked tons on motorcycles and some clutch noise at cold engine seems to be normalised, but since this is a car and it (most likely) have a dual mass flywheel and lots of issues with these, it worried me a little.,5: As ive understood, when the flywheel goes bad, it ""comes apart"" internally, resulting in a horrible noise and the fear that its going to blow up any time. Is that correct? I could believe this is caused by people driving the cars wrongly by shifting too early and putting too much load on the flywheel over time when going up hills etc in 3. gear with the engine speed is just over idle speed. So to effectively avoid this is simply not to run the car on too low rpms+high loads over time? Right?,I love this car, but ive heard loads of horror stories with steering collumn locks going bad, EPB going bad/refusing to release the EPB and other electrical issues.. Other problems with these cars are rust. Mine has got a little rust attack over the rear right wheel arch, so im gonna have that sorted soon. Mainly I really wanted a skoda octavia with the same engine but less possible issues including no EPB and the ""normal"" key, not the ""chip"" that the passat has, but when I found this passat for half my budget, I had to get it lol. My next car might be a Skoda tho...",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

One of them commented that the most expensive - bar none - Maybach in the world is the Platinum edition - where the ENTIRE bodywork is casted out of platinum, for those billionaire who already have everything.  It is then supposedly sprayed to look like a 'normal' Maybach so as to be 'modest'.  I have never been able to confirm whether the Platinum edition Maybach exists or not, but its an intriguing thought:  the Maybach's bodyframe easily weighs - what? - 3 tons? 4 tons? Minus the engine, upholstery, electronics, plastics, insulation, carpet, teak-in-lays and other non-metallic what nots, it is still easily 2.5 tons at least.  At USD1800 per Oz (0.0283g), it should cost about USD50mil (just for the bare metal cost of the metalframe bodywork).",#9,,NA,NA,NA,9,4,

I posted a little bit about what led me to these forums which was the Nissan z370 vs Porsche Caymen S thread.,I hate to sound like a troll but, why is it the Nissan Fans are so hardcore pro proving the z370 is better? As I already admitted I'm no big car guy... however, I am becoming more interested in them.,I am not saying I won't jump ship one day and settle for the less expensive Nissan sports car.. however, in many ways... there is just no comparing porsche to Nissan.,I read the review for the Porsche Cayman on a website.. They said it was worth every penny in their minds yet pointed out Nissan fans would argue for the z370 and point out the price difference and there was no defending the Porche price in comparison.,For me I am .. pretty annoyed.. while I have never driven either car and I do admit that from what I read both are fantastic cars..The fact that I see so many Nissan fans jumping on the ""Its stupid to get the Porsche"" wagon.. and so many Porsche fans just blowing it off makes me wonder if the Nissan fans aren't just overly enthusiastic about having a great car.,Given the choice with a test drive.. I would need to drive both cars a lot to really decide. Given the choice without a test drive.. I'd take the Porsche hands down. I guess its in part because in my mind.. Get a performance car from a performance brand is a much more logical choice then getting a performance car from a brand that makes cars for general use.,I am curious though.. as to why the Porche Cayman fans still remain loyal to the Cayman. (Which.. taking it a step further.. it seems like MORE people are getting into the Cayman with the post like ""why the Cayman is the best Porsche yet"" post..,I do personally feel like its an apples an oranges issue.. However, I guess that still doesn't stop me from wanting a Cayman after college.. and then a 911 Gt2 (or turbo) Once I have actually moved up in my career..",#1,,NA,NA,NA,56,7,

Recently saw one black prototype of this new 911 close to Bolzano, Italiy. No chance to take a photo, it was gone, before I got out my camera.,Is it only me wondering why some of the coupe prototypes seem to have kind of ""taped"" or camuflaged rear windows?,I have no clue if this is true, but can this be a ventilation slot integrated into the rear roof pillars?,It seems that the rear window is slighly bent inside the roofline. What do you think?,In general I believe that the new 911 is not totally new. When you follow the history, the 996 got one facelift, then it was replaced by 997. The 997 shared the windows, the doors and roof with the 996, but all other bodywork and chassis was renewed. The 997 also got a facelift, before it was replaced by a total new 991. The 991 got his facelift last year, so if Porsche follows what they did when changing from 996 to 997, the base car is still similar. When looking at all the available prototypes, it confirms that doors, roof and windows are identical to that on the 991, so the new 911 (if it is really called 992) is an evolution of the 991. Just my opinion - and no negative tendencies. I am really looking forward to see it on the road finally.",#92,,NA,NA,NA,4,8,

And there was no G83 at the display, so... you know.,Just as an addendum to this topic - I'm really really impressed by the performance of new M3/M4. It's completly different than previous generation. I understand that some people find this new ""smoothness"" in driving a bit disappoining. It's not that ""radical"" and agressive, but on the other hand it became much more useful in daily driving and also more effective on racetrack. Two years ago I did the same course on the same racetrack with old M3/M4, and there's basically no comparision between these cars. The new one is simply perfectly refined piece of german engineering. xDrive version might be interesting, but I'll stick with RWD.

Jaguar / Land Rover,2016 Jaguar XS Spy Shots (Codenamed X760),post-703351,"Jul 8, 2014",dermo911,"Dude, Duuude, Duuuuuude!!!,Serious?!? What is wrong here? How much do ze Germans pay you to write all that deluded staff? Honestly, no one tells you to buy JLR cars if you don’t want to, but writing all those things, bending truth, mixing real facts and fantasy is definitely going too far! How can you say the new XE will be rubbish if it doesn’t really exist yet???,Really, get a girlfriend, get laid, get a hobby, drink warm milk... Do something…,I really have no time to get into a huge discussion here, so I’ll make one big statement. Try to read it carefully and not to argue if you don’t have any really sound grounds.,Basically what our Kilcrohane here is trying to say, essences around the following aspects:,According to the press (or even wiki), the XE will be based on an all new iQ Al platform. Even if iQ Al was based on 2003 X350 (XJ, XK, F-type) architecture, designed under Ford, what’s wrong with that? It is a good, clever structure with future-development potential. E.g. XJ is at least 200 kg lighter than similar A8. And do not forget, Jag XE will be the only mass-produced car in the WORLD to make use of Al and aviation technology with all the benefits.,Also, speaking of platforms. Yes, car makers sometimes use old and time-approved structures. Golf 6 was built on Golf 5 platform, which is still used in the actual Tiguan (Btw Golf 6 was a cheaper and less advanced version of Golf 5, sold for higher price. No lying-, cheating-, blah-, … accusations against ze Germans here?). The Porsche Macacan is nothing but Audi Q5, which is nothing but Audi A4, which is being built on basically the same platform for decades (centuries? millenniums?). BMW 5’s platform is quite dated too and is used with slight changes for ages. RR Evoque is built on the old EUCD, so what? A Platform is a platform, basically just an underfloor and mount-points for aggregates. The parts you bolt to the platform is what’s important: diffs, engines, gearboxes, etc. And everything is OK here with the Evoque and LR Freelander.,“Platform” is basically a marketing gag. Platforming makes only sense if you built a lot of different cars with same underpinnings, like VW does (Golf, A3, Octavia, etc.). If you built one or two similar cars, you don’t really need a Platform. The only benefit of MQB is its scalability and in NO other way is it any better than the old EUCD. New Golf 7 is no lighter or better to drive than Golf 6, with or without MQB. I have driven a lot of Golfs over the years and honestly spotted no big difference between generations.,Besides that, LR is doing quite a good job with the EUCD: clever engineering, right components, beautiful ride comfort and good off-roadability, broad usage of plastic to save weight, etc.,So will Jag hopefully do with the new iQ Al.,How do you know that? You did not even see it yet! It will come on time, will be good, reliable, powerful and economic, like any of its rivals. Won’t be a class-leader, but will definitely not be rubbish. Full stop!,Don’t forget, it will also give JLR freedom. Since decades JLR (stripped by former owners Ford and BMW of its own engine plant) is forced to buy motors from the rivals. This is also the reason why it took them so long to launch the actual power units: the new engine assembly had to be built in the first place, people must have been hired, engineers had to make their work, etc. It is not easy for a small company like JLR to introduce such a mammoth project. Have a little respect for their efforts!,All that VW exuberance with “future engines” (electric turbos and other crap) is quite a big marketing banana. As is “downsizing”, “triple-quod-turbo” and “double clutch” - all are VW “innovations”, which come at a price. First of all low reliability: no engine, delivering more than 100-120 bhp per 1000 cc is going to live longer than 150 000 – 200 000 km without a major overhaul, neither do double-clutch gearboxes. That is why a modern German car is a one way product, which you buy like a pair of socks and throw away than something newer and shinier comes out.,Could be, but again, what is wrong with using good, time-approved design? As long as it performs as good or even better than the rivals? AJ133 and AJ126 are good motors, smooth and powerful. Great fun to use, much better when most of their turbo-Germanic opponents. The only problem they have is failing to confirm with Euro-6. It is a big problem, which is why JLR wanted to buy German engines, trying to avoid designing their own new v6 or v8 units (and big disels), which is costly for a small firm. Can’t blame them for trying to save money though… And the best bit is: you can tell why ze Germans said “Nein”, because they are scared;-).,Come on. Passat has always played in its own league. Besides, every new generation was a huge leap forward, but VW had never introduced any major changes during the (quite long) production cycle, where the other cars evolve quite a lot during their production time. Passat is a good car, but will never be a rival for XE for these reasons: 1. It has a C&A (Marks and Spenser, ALDI, etc.) badge compared to Jag’s Gucci/Prada sticker, 2. It uses a FWD (MQB – for platform fetishists) architecture. 3. It looks quite boring and no any different than its predecessor. 4. It is quite very expensive for a big Golf.,Hm. RR and RRS won’t be hurt much by new Rolls Royce and Bentley SUVs for these reasons: 1. RR/RRS have new models since ca. 2 years, which are selling like warm sausages all other the globe. 2. Bentley and Rolls SUVs are going to be quite ugly versions of VW Tuareg and X5. Neither Tuareg, no X5 have ever been good off-roaders/good cars. 3. Bentley and Rolls Royce will be built by BMW or VW, who have not that much experience in building SUVs, unlike LR/RR, who builds 4x4s for more than 50 years. 4. Bentley and Rolls are exclusive products made in small numbers (so are the future Maserati and Lambo SUVs), which is no match to the relatively mass-produced RR/RRS.,You can’t really compare Porsche Macacan and RR Evoque either. These are two different price and size categories. Macacan is also quite (very) pig ugly. LR did some great job with the Evoque (and I am not the biggest fan myself), having found a way to sell a quite simple piece of machinery as a pricy premium product. And the success story is continuing. Chapeau.,Jag SUV is the real rival to the Macacan, and since it will have an Al body and utilize LR 4x4 experience, it will definitely be a good match (will probably also be less expensive and surely a million times better looking).,So, concluding, we see that things are not quite as dramatic, as our friend here is desperately trying to make us believe. Yes, JLR are quite under pressure, yes Indians are greedy and difficult to talk to, yes JLR have no large sister company with its shelves full of crisp engines, gear boxes, etc. But they are fighting, preserving heritage and tradition for generations to come and producing some great cars, like the RR/RRS or the F-type. The new XE will definitely be a great car, so the new Discovery and the Jag SUV.,PS: JLR is a part of global and British automotive history. Love it or hate it. At least the company and its products have heart and soul, heritage and roots. German cars are heartless pieces of metal, made by huge concerns with millions of employees. The big 3 (MB, BMW, VW) are protected by laws, enjoy unlimited government support, pay fewer taxes. Everything JLR does not have. Despite that JLR fight for survival and does quite a good job, teasing big german Goliaths. Germany lives out of its car-industry and its car-industry lives out of Germany. If MB goes kaput one day, the whole Germany will go kaput. If JLR closes, no one will notice any financial impact.,So, dude, Kilcrohane here, return back the cheque, ze germans have sent to you for writing your pointless insinuations here, go for a walk or take a cold shower and then apply with Apple to write in some forums on how dated Samsung’s Galaxy devices are and how good iPhone is or something. But the best decision in your case will always be to keep your freaking opinion for yourself.,PPS: It is actually quite amusing to read how some people accuse the AUTOCAR and other magazines of favoring Jags. If you have ever had an Automotorundsport in your hands, you’ll know what favoritism really is (see e.g. recent ADAC-scandals, where test result were forged in favor of some manufacturers). The truth is, that there is no truth and unbiased opinion among motor-press. Buying a car for a guy is like picking a girlfriend: is a matter of sympathy, emotions and character. Does not really have to do much with platforms or downsizing, does it?",#478,post: 701915,NA,Female,NA,4,2,

Is this just something you want to believe just because you hate Lexus? The 2014 IS chassis is confirmed to be developed and much more rigid (something that is not done on mere facelifts), the wheelbase is longer and wider (something not done on mere facelifts), it has a much more roomier interior, and all new exterior design. It's like you just saw that its body shape and design has similarities to the previous IS and decided for yourself it's a facelift only. God forbid that car companies keep a design theme throughout its car's generations. Hell, the new 3 series would be guilty of being just a facelift if we all think like this.,But I shouldn't really blame you too much because people could be confused by the 2013 RX and LS, which ARE mere extensive refreshes (mid-cycle for the RX and in the LS's special case, very very late into its cycle).

Sounds like a few of you have some expensive cars and you don't want the 'common' person to be associated with your self-diagnosed elevated 'class'.,I have only driven the A250 so I cannot comment on the other variants in the range - but I loved it. I got to drive an E250 and a C250 at length when my car was being serviced and I found them very nice, but also very boring (an image Merc is trying to shake!). The A250 is very similar in pricing to the Golf GTI (GTI needs to be optioned up to meet it) but looks 1000 times better and is very similar in performance in my opinion. The little things like the interior, the sound of the AMG exhaust......etc make it a nice car when you consider it hits the road in the mid 50k segment here in Australia. Mercedes were trying to get in on the market that BMW and Audi were dominating with the 1 series/A3 and they have done it very well.

I did hit some corners really very hard.  In the past 10,000kms this is the first drive of its kind that I have had.  While I'm sure the extra grunt of the 45 would have been awesome for overtaking I don't think it would have made much of a difference to the overall time.  I do want to live and am not on a racetrack so I did keep it relatively tame making sure that I could stick to my own lane.  But that aside, the 250 really does make overtaking a breeze, it does have a nice amount of pull when you give it a squirt with the left foot.,Anyway really impressed, it was one dirty little beast by the time I got back.

There is a mystery about the marking. Solving this mystery is not important to restoring the engine, but i'm a very curious person.,All the parts that are from the left-hand side of the engine (port side of the plane) are stamped with a ""V"" (no quotes of course). The parts from the right side of the engine are NOT stamped with anything. I find this strange.,Does anyone out there know what this V marking might mean? And just to confuse things, ALL of the pushrods (12 rods, 2 per) are also stamped with a V. Hmmm.,Any help would be appreciated. Plus any suggestions as to where MORE info on this engine could be found would be apprectiated. I already have all the easily found (on the internet) websites, and have visited the people at Le Bourget in Paris where they have a RUNNING model of this engine. It is magnificient.,Thanks in advance.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Mercedes-Benz,black smoke from exhaust on C220CDI,post-433474,"Jan 1, 2010",hiki08,"(haven't visited for a while and the topics seems to have changed quite a bit here! anyway, hope I'm posting in the right place,),the W204 c220CDI diesel i drive (08 Apr car) has had the problem of black smoke coming from the exhaust pipe when I get just slightly enthusiastic on the pedal. It doesn't happen all the time (or at least I don't notice it.. maybe because I don't always have to press on it too hard?) but it's noticable when I start up from traffic lights or try to accelerate on an uphill. Sometimes the engine has been just started for under 5min, other times it's been running for 20min+. At first I was told not to press to hard on the pedal when the car was new, which I'm pretty sure I didn't. That said, after 2 years the car is still under 10K's since I do quite a bit of city driving.,Is there a problem with the exhaust system? I'd bring it into the dealer if only they wouldn't charge me for checking it, which I doubt? So I've been living with the problem for a while now. Thought I should get some opinions from more experienced people,Cheers and Happy New Year!",#1,,NA,NA,NA,4,0,

I've seen things ranging from ""the E250 having plenty of grunt so why bother with the E350"", to ""the E350's V6 is so much more refined and the 7speed box it comes with is worth paying the extra alone"". What do people who have driven both think?  As I would be wanting Distronic plus I would have to get the auto box for the 250 CDI anyway if I did go for that one, but that's only the 5-speeder and from what I've read the 7-speeder the 350 CDI comes with is considerably better.  I tend to drive pretty economically though (and mostly motorway miles) so I'm not sure I would actually use the extra power of the 350 - and of course there would be a bit of a penalty at the pumps going for the larger engine, though both would be considerably better than what I drive currently of course (230K CLK).,I'm also undecided on whether the Sport trim is worth it over the SE (given that I would probably want either beige or red leather, which is standard on the SE but not the Sport trim) - I do prefer the two-tone version of the leather on the Sport though!,Thanks for any opinions you could share!",#1,,"Southampton, UK",NA,NA,6,0,CLK 230 Kompressor (W208)

Mercedes-Benz,Mercedes – A Bad News,post-341209,"Oct 28, 2008",isa,"I have a Mercedes A class, year 1999, parked at the Mercedes Benz's garage since 2002, when the engine was damaged by adulterate gasoline, which in contact to the oil produces a sludge that destroys the engine.  The car was sent to their garage twice and they simply didn't change the oil.  Later, they charged me approximately U$ 1,500,00 to give an estimate cost of the service, or approximately U$ 8.000,00 for a new motor.  In 2002, I took the case to court and I won!  But I haven't got anything yet.  Since 2007, Mercedes Benz's representatives and their lawyer's office have been postponing the jury sentence with all possible and imaginable petitions.,While my car was at Mercedes Benz's parking lot, I contracted a cancer tumour.  If I could make an account for all the money I've spent on transportation these last five years, if I could attest all I didn’t do for the benefit of my health because of lack of a car, MERCEDES BENZ would own me today much more than just a car.  Since we have in Brazil one of the worst judicial system of the world (five years for a simple trial as this one, and it isn't over yet!), the sentence was that they would have to fix the car – the same one, dead for five years with its engine inside – and give me back in ""perfect"" conditions (we are still discussing over losses that they insist I didn't have).,MERCEDES BENZ has been, for ages, an assurance of respect, honesty and intelligent relationship towards their clients.  Unfortunately, I realise that these values, so important in the past, are not relevant any more.  Today, what really matters is to have the power and money to get away with anything till the last instance.,I wonder if MERCEDES BENZ treats their costumers with such disrespect and disdain in the first world countries.  I would like to know if, in Germany, they would sustain a court appeal for such a lost and ridiculous cause to any major company that cares about their costumers.,Isabella Lago,Mercedes A Class 99/99, plate LCX 8867, chassis nº 9BMMF33E8XA008973, bought in 1999 at Ago Mercedes, Rio de Janeiro.",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,

Mercedes-Benz,Sheer Madness - Brabus SV12 S Biturbo Coupe: In Detail,post-187726,"May 18, 2007",auto1,"I totally agree with the idea that AMG have upped their game so much now that there is little need for an additional tuner on top of the official tuner. I think what Brabus are going for now with their incaration of the CL600 is just a bit of marketing and the hope that lower spec models will sell due to the ""pedigree"" of their flagship model. I think there is something to be said for the years testing etc that goes into a production AMG car, so when they decide to limit the power to well below 730 break, its for a reason. By the sound of the ""mods"" on the Brabus CL it sounds like a completely new car especially in as far as the engine is concerned...just leaves wondering if this car is any better than the standard CLs in terms of driving experience and the like.",#13,,NA,NA,NA,10,5,

I was wondering what kind of upgrades were available and what kind of extra performance I could expect.  Performance now isn't bad, but for what I would like it is a little shabby, topping out around 131.  I was also wondering if anybody knew the speed the stock tires are rated for, I am not sure if my tires are just getting old or if the high speed driving has worn them down.

Mercedes-Benz,Is the new Lexus LS460 a threat?,post-31273,"Jan 8, 2006",georgl,"An eight-speed-automatic is not a technological masterpiece, when they didn't improved the old six-speed-Aisin-version (Aisin is only used in cheap german cars like VW Beetle, all better models get a ZahnradfabrikFriedrichshafen) this automatic is maybe not even a threat to the ZF-six-speed. Because of the structure of an automatic, a six-speed-transmission can become a seven, eight or even nine-speed-automatic with the same mechanics! It's just the software!,The 7G-Tronic from MB is not the best automatic because it has seven speeds, it's because of all the little improvements only possible with nearly 50 years experience and the only automaic-production in car industry that wasn't outsourced (MB is the only car maker left that produces it's automatic-transmissions itself).,Lexus is No.1 in marketing, because of that, they are a threat (at least in the US).",#23,,NA,NA,NA,20,5,

Mercedes-Benz,Love it or hate it,post-17,"Sep 13, 2005",Slash,"For as much as we like our MBs, their problems with quality and reliability are becoming more pronounced plus the new design direction that the entire line of cars have taken these past years imho lost their appeal as a top of the world design. As an owner of MBs this has gone too far to the point that as much as I hate it, I will not buy MBs again unless they go back to a distinctive design (and get better quality).,Fortune magazine has recently published an article on this and I couln'd agree more. Here's the article and link:,-----------------,MERCEDES-BENZ,Mercedes Hits a Pothole,Owner complaints are up. Resale values are down. And competitors are gaining ground. Is Mercedes-Benz losing its shine?,Spend $25,000 on a car that doesn't run the way you expect it to, and you get pretty angry. Spend $50,000 or $100,000, and you get really angry. Just listen to the anguished howls of Mercedes-Benz owners on websites like troublebenz.com, lemonmb.com, and mercedesproblems.com, as they vent about the latest mishap to afflict their Benzes. Depending on the model, the complaints range from faulty key fobs and leaky sunroofs to balky electronics that leave drivers and their passengers stranded. Regardless of the severity, a single sentiment runs through the gripes: This shouldn't be happening to a Mercedes.,No auto manufacturer wants to hear customers whine, but the sensitivity is magnified at Mercedes, which commands a steep premium for its products because of the belief that they are engineered to higher standards, are assembled more carefully, and feature more advanced technology than more pedestrian brands. So it's not good news when customer surveys by J.D. Power & Associates rank Mercedes quality as much worse than average—in 26th place, behind Oldsmobile, in one survey. Other industry researchers see slipping consumer sentiment and declining resale values. The bad vibes have resonated all the way to Stuttgart, Germany, where Mercedes has made its home for more than 100 years. Longtime boss Juergen Hubbert is devoting a good deal of energy these days to unraveling the problems that have led to the customer complaints. ""Quality is part of our heritage, one of our core values,"" Hubbert says. ""That's why we are working like hell to solve the problems we've seen."",Life would be relatively simple if quality were the only issue on Hubbert's plate. But as he gets ready to retire in 2005, after nearly 40 years with the company, he faces lots of other unfinished business....,Complete article here:",#1,,NA,NA,NA,1,0,
